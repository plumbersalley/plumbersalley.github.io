<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally kept at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
