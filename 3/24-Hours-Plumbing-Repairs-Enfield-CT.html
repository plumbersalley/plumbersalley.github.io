Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated and readily available for usage. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see apparent signs of corrosion, request that a new one be set up.</p>
