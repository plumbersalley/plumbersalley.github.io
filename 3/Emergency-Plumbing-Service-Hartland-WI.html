<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

<p>The most effective method to address tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
