There are two main kinds of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Check valve assembly (DCV) and decreased pressure zone assembly (RPZ) devices are most frequently utilized in commercial centers.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to determine water sources and situations that need backflow prevention devices. For house, it is essential for owners to inform the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial home, the District reviews using each brand-new tenant. If the current backflow is not up to District code, the correction needs to be made prior to water service is permitted. Cost for the device is covered by either the occupant or the property owner.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
