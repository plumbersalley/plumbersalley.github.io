During regrowth, salted water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are designed to supply years of security. There are many regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water turbidity, quality or temperature can all trigger the assembly to degrade in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may seldom need repair while some are fixed regularly. The test information from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
