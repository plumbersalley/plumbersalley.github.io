<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great guy. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70.

If using one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures.</p>
