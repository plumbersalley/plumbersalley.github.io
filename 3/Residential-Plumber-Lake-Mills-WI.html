It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had excellent reviews and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>
