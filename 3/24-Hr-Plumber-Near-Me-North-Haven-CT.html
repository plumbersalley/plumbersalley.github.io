Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

Usage of a camera in your sewer line can help us better diagnose sewer backups and sewer line and drain problems. Jim Dandy Sewer & Plumbing offers the latest technology in video sewer and plumbing drain inspection throughout the Puget Sounds.</p>
