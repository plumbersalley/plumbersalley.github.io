<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper safety measures if using one of these products.</p>
