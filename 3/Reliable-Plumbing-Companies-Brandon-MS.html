Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper safety measures if using one of these products.</p>
