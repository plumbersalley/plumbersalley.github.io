<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Burlington NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under your house is merely the cost to install a new plumbing system which can range from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install brand-new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per linear foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per direct foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under homes, often times in concrete. It is quite common to leave the old pipes in location after disconnecting them. The new pipe is simply installed in the path of least resistance. Depending on the style of your house, the pipe can be installed in the attic or under a crawl space.</p>
