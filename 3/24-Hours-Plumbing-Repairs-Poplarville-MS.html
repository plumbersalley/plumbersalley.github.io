Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's whole plumbing system, consisting of both supply of water and drain lines.

Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist identify.</p>
<p>Waste disposal unit systems might cost more when they need to suit local water and sewer capacities.
