Consult your water softener dealership for details on resin replacement.</p>
<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered up; you do not get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in studs, joists, and floors. Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat dealing with a substandard plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims.
