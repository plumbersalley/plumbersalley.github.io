<p>Having another concern with your toilet? If so, you're most likely questioning if it's going to require more than an easy repair this time-or perhaps even a new toilet.

Sodium will not cause lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening adds only an extremely small amount of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about extremely low salt" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
