To prevent the headache of clogged drains, overruning toilets, and backed-up sewer lines, it's important to have regular, preventative maintenance carried out by a qualified Chicago sewer and drain expert.</p>

In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in studs, joists, and floors. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a substandard plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the job with insurance claims, lost time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
