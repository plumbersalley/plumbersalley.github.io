<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank.
