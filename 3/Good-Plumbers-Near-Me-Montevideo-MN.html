Like practically whatever in life, there's a excellent and bad  side to both gas and electrical hot water heater.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel eventually experiences rust and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
