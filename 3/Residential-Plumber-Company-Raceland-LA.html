<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
