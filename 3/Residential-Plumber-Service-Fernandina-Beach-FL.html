<h3>Water Filtration Systems in Fernandina Beach Florida</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
