<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts.
