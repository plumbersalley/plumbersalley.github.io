<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Hoboken NJ</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
