<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of little, maybe less vital things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up rust Carbon dioxide will possibly contribute to the development of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more destructive. The presence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to correlate with specific geologic conditions.</p>
