<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running devices such as water heaters. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decaying of organic matters like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer. However, to prevent off that risk, mercaptans are added into gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make certain to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
