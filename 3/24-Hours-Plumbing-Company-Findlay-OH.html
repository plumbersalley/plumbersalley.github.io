Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>If you have an older house, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan.

Absolutely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is revealing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate option to do just that. Nevertheless, if the balanced out worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>
