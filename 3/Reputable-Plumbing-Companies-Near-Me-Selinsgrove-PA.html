<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Selinsgrove PA</h3>
<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system. Backflow can contaminate the water supply.
