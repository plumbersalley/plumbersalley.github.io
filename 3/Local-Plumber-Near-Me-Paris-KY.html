They use a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt.

The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
