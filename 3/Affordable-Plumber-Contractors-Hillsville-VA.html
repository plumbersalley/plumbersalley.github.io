<p>The most efficient method to address tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The cost to repipe a home with PEX tubing is $0.40 to $0.50 per direct foot depending upon the size of your home and the degree of replumbing you're doing.
