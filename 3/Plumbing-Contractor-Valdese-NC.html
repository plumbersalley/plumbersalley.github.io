<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Valdese NC</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Leaky faucets are bothersome, and replacing them is an undesirable expenditure. Conserve money by repairing the faucet yourself. Is your water heater leaking or making sounds water?
