You might need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is fairly new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing details. Inspect the list of state licensing firms to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise keeps a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
