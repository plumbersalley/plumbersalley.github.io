Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leakages that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components unusable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain effectively or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. In some cases drain repair requirements can be solved relatively rapidly by a skilled handyman.

In many cases, a handyman might identify that a replacement part is needed (like a tailpiece, reducer, or PVC  trap) to ensure normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to discuss repair choices.</p>

<p>Beneath the sink, stack the fiber gasket, backup flange, and installing ring, and slide onto the underside of the flange. Install the snap ring by pulling it open and snapping into place. Heating water represent approximately 20 percent of the typical house's energy budget plan. Some gas-fired tankless water heaters claim to cut energy costs by as much as half.
