<p>Changing the old disposal with an identical new one is less complex than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this may be something to consider. A totally different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into place. A protected seal is a must. When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the brand-new disposal, taking care to link wires accurately, and the base covered to safeguard the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>
<p>We focus on repair, service and installation of all makes and designs of gas water heaters, electrical hot water heater and tankless hot water heater.
