The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>Electrical Breakdowns: Modern water heaters likewise rely on electrical elements. You could be left with no hot water if something inside the system fails The discharge line is pressurized and can run some range. How far is the softener from the washing machine drain?
