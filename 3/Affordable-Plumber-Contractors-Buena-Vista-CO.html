<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium.
