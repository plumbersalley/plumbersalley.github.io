<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
