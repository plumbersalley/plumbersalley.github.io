The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to weld or spot a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to save money. While this might work in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the very same product as other pipes in your house, meaning that problem could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you peace of mind and avoid bigger leakages down the road.</p>
