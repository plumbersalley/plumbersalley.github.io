<p>The very best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by installing a pressure lowering valve (PRV). A PRV will manage water pressure as it comes into the house. According to San Diego utilities, a PRV can also help to save water as components in the house will use less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Inspection Department is accountable for safeguarding the water supply by guaranteeing, through strategy review and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow. The plumbing inspectors are likewise responsible for ensuring the waste plumbing is properly vented and caught so the plumbing securely brings waste away while causing no health problems.</p>
