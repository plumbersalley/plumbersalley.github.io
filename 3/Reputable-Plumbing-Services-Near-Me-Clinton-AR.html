<p>Our team at All Phase Plumbing also utilizes drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also known as trenchless pipe lining is a resilient and excellent choice for your broken pipes. The pipe lining procedure involves our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is totally filled, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all imperfections and cracks. The liner is left to solidify in location for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. As soon as the procedure is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
