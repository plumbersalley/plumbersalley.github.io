A basic by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>

According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is considered very low sodium" by the Fda.</p>
