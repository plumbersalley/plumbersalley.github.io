<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will establish. Often the service is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is required to fix the issue. Other times a more substantial service is needed: repiping.</p>

As soon as the procedure is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be examined one more time to make sure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
