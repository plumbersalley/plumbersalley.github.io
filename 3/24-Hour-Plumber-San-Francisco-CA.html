<h3>Tub Replacement in San Francisco California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
