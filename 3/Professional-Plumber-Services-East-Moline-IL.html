<p>Purchasing a home is a huge investment. Knowing if you have galvanized pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be convenient when negotiating the sale of a house.

<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next step would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail below the area to catch water then unscrew the two threaded caps that hold the curved area of the pipe in place. Nowadays, the majority of kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
