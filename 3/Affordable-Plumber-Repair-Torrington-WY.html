<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the culprit. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can cause trouble too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
