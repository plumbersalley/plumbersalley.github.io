<p>Family owned and operated considering that 2003, RT Plumbing Services provides industry-leading plumbing knowledge, house redesigning service, and water heater conversions and replacements to the higher Fort Worth, TX neighborhood. It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a correctly functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations subject to water damage. Adequate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
