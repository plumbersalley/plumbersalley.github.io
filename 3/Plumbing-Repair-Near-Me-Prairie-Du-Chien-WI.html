<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
