<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, maybe less critical things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

From small repairs to intricate replacements, you can count on our family-owned and -run company to look after your plumbing whether it's an emergency or scheduled maintenance. Customer satisfaction and on-time service is guaranteed.</p>
