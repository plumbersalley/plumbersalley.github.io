<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up throughout construction of a brand-new or renovated structure is installed by well-informed artisans in accordance with appropriate codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you normally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining fixture itself. Clogs in a component can cause harmful damage to your draining system the longer they continue.</p>
