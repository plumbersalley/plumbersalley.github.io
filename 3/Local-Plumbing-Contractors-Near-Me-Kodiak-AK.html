<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades.

This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
