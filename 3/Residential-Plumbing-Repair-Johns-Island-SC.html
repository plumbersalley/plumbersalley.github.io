<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is normally made of aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank.

Lastly, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and need to continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to make sure that all food particles have been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
<p>Master plumber: To become a master plumber, a person needs to have a particular variety of years' experience as a journeyman plumber, in addition to a partner's degree or training at a trade school. A master plumber should pass an examination that normally includes both composed and practical understanding. They should also finish continuing education hours every year.
