Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
