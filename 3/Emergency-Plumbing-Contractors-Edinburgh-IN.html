<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
