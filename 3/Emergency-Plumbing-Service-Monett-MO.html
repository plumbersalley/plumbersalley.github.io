<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the potable system providing the make-up water. This can force the potable water to reverse its instructions of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Prospective pollutants can then enter the drinkable water supply. The best way to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
