Throughout regrowth, salty water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is normally carried elsewhere to a nearby treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be susceptible to clogging due to the fact that there simply isn't enough a high adequate flow to flush out the debris.</p>
