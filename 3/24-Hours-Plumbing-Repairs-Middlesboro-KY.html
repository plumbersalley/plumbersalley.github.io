<p>If the toilet can not be repaired, or if the repair cost methods replacement cost, we'll discuss your options. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular approach of clearing clogs. They normally make use of sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide to dissolve gunky accumulation. While efficient at eliminating blockages, they might do your plumbing more damage than good. Here are 3 reasons to avoid putting these harsh chemicals down your drain.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>At this point, the specialist crew makes sure everything is operating properly. Your plumbing system is checked for integrity, and all connections are inspected. A professional site inspection is vital to an effective repipe. As soon as the plumbing system is inspected and given the green light, its time to clean up the mess. Its time to patch the holes in the wall and repaint. After the new piping system is set up, the water is turned back on, and the plumbing system is pressure tested and then flushed out.</p>
