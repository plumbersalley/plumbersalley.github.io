Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat dealing with a shoddy plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>
