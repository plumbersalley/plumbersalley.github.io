Some homeowners will attempt to remove the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, specifically if you are dealing with a small drain clog. However, they are normally short-term fixes that do not offer long-term resolutions.</p>
