<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Frequently, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water pipe. Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Strainers are advised prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire fighting water lines. No strainer is to be utilized in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
