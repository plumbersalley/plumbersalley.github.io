<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you need to probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line.

When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
