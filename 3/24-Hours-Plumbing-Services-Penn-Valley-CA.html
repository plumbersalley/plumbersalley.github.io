<p>When the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
