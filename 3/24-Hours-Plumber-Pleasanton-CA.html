<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
