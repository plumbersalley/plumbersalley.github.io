<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc.
