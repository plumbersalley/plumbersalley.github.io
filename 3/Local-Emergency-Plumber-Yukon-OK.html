<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Note: Tough water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently because hard water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Tough minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized during regrowth. Finally, water including the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
