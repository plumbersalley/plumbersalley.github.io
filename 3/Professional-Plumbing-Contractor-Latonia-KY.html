If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.

<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a practical option, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many downsides to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
