<p>Backflow is a potential issue in a water supply because it can spread out infected water back through a distribution system. For instance, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or prospective connection between the general public supply of water and a source of contamination or contamination) can permit contaminants or pollutants to go into the safe and clean water supply.

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
