<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
