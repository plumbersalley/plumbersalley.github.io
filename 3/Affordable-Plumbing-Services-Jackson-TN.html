Finally, a quality contractor will not threat working with a shoddy plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>

Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
