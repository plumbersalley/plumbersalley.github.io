<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Baton Rouge LA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
