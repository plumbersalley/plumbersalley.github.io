<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Water softeners will run to drain during backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the system).

Not to mention plumbing code might be broken without correct backflow prevention.</p>
