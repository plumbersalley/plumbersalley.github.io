<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
