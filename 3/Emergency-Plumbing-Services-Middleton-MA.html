<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your hot water heater installation visit. Installing natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As hard water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water adhere to the beads, and the cured water heads out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the culprit. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
