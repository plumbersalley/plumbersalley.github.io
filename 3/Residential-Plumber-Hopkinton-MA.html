<p>You most likely know one thing about your drains: they take water from your bath tubs, showers, and sinks to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working correctly that's actually all you need to know about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what type of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber is available in-- they have the competence to diagnose an issue and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
