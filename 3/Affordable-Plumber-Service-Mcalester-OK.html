<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for homeowners. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>
