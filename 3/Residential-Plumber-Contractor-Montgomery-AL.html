<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a tough task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
