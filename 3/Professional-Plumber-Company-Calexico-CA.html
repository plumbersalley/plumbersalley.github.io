<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.

The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
