The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both places. The backflow preventer you choose should be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed should have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair specialist understands the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
