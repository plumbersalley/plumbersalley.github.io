<p>Galvanized steel drinkable water supply and distribution pipes are typically found with nominal pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom utilized today for brand-new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which connect with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently recognized just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively pricey, and hard to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical usage for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building code non-combustibility requirements usually found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, specifically when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
