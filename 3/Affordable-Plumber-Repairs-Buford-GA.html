<p>You might be tempted to weld or patch a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to conserve money. While this might work in the short-term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the same product as other pipes in your home, suggesting that difficulty might be brewing in other places in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you comfort and avoid bigger leakages down the road.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
