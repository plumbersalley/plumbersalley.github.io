Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the daily expenditures and frustrations sustained by tough water, a water softener is ultimately an investment that will conserve you a substantial amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is considerably surpassed by the cash and energy saved.</p>

<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
