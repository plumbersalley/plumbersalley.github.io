Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is always under pressure can just stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of least expensive pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to assist battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream could cause a turnaround in flow.</p>
