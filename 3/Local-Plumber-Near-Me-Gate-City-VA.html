<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to clogs that originate inside the house. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, likewise called tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems.
