<p>Your sewer line carries wastewater far from the sinks, toilets, and showers of your house.

<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a practical solution, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
