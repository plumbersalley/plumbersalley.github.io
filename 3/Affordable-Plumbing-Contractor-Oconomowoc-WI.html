<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Oconomowoc WI</h3>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making an excellent seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water.

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
