<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Shortened to TAC, this technique uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where firmness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline form that will not cling to surface areas.

Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
