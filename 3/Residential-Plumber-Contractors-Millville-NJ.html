<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Millville NJ 08332</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
