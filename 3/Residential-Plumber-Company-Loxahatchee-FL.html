<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
