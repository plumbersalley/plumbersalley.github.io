<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is necessary to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger jams and clogs - think about composting or positioning these items in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can harden and gather in your drain also. After finishing cooking, think about putting remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or easily location in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>

<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
