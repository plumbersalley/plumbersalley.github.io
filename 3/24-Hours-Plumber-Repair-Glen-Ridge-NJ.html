<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, just connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or buy one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>

A toilet's tank is composed of multiple little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their regular usage. When these parts wear out, they result in tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
