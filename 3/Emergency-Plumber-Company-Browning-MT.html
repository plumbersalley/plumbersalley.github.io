<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Research study compared cleaning agent dosage, water hardness, and washing temperature level to see if firmness had an impact on detergent savings. The research study consisted of tests that got rid of tough soils, in addition to assessing shooting and spotting. Scientists found that softened water uses practically 30% less detergent, but cleans as well as water at 10 gpg solidity level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent savings increases to nearly 70%.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
