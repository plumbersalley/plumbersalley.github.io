<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a new burner kit and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself.

When these parts wear, they result in small leakages that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as soon as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can likewise result in flooding and water damage.</p>
