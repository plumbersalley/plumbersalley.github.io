<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Company in Henrico</h2>

During regrowth, salty water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Is your house 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product used in plumbing.
