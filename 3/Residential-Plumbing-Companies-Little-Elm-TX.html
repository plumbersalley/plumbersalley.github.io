<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
