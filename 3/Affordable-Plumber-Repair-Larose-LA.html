<p>It is necessary that the backflow prevention assembly match the location's particular hydraulic conditions and is suitable to protect against the degree of hazard present Any BPA set up should be a design approved and noted by University of Southern California Foundation for Cross Connection Control and Hydraulic Research (see our Authorized Backflow Prevention Assemblies List ). Likewise, the BPA should be installed according to the most current plumbing code adopted by the City of Austin.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when used in combating a fire. Firefighters by and large are not worried about backflow prevention problems. They are concerning with protecting individuals's lives and to a lesser extent their residential or commercial property. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source offered to achieve that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and might as an outcome mean that the level of defense on the fire protection system may need to be increased to a high hazard defense level.</p>

The brand-new pipes that are utilized are usually made of copper since of their durability and other elements. Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
