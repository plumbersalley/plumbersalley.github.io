<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most apparent indications of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your home. Even if the problem originates with the municipal system, it's still smart to generate the experts to limit the damage to your house.</p>
<p>When it concerns fixing a broken or failing sewer line, there are a few alternatives.
