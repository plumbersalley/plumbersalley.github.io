The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.

When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
