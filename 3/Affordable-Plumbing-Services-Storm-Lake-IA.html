<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers readily available that you might run into. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check".

Dual Checks have losses similar to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
