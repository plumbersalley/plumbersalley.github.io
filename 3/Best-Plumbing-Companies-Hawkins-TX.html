<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for many building and construction contractors (or their staff members). The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby removing hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Another difference in between soft and difficult water is dullness of your hair and clothing. If you have tough water, your hair may feel dull and lack body, and your clothing will begin to fade and might wear previously.

If your kit just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.
