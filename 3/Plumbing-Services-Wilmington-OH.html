<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when utilized in fighting a fire. Firefighters by and big are not worried about backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with protecting people's lives and to a lesser level their home. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source readily available to achieve that objective. This can develop cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome suggest that the level of protection on the fire security system may need to be increased to a high hazard security level.</p>
<p>There's an excellent chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This corrosion can result in a buildup of lead, which can have many negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
