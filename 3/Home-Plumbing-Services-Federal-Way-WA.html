<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>There are a few choices when it comes to repairing a broken or failing sewer line. The best option for your home will depend upon a few aspects, consisting of the age of your existing pipes, the degree of damage, and your budget plan.
