<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
