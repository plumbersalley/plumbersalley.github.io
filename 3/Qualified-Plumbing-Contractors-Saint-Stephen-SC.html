Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
