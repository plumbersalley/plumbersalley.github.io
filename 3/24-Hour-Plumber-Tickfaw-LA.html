<p>It is estimated that the average individual spends over 3 years of their life resting on the toilet, and many bathroom readers are at danger of ending up being permanently attached to the fixture. Which is why selecting a comfy, reliable toilet seat is exceptionally essential. However, you have to ensure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely shaped bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a great idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been specifically created to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or will not disperse your weight equally and could ultimately cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
