<p>When your bathtub drains or your toilet flushes is never ever a great sign, an odd gurgling sound.

Many fire sprinkler heads, except sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Usually, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Despite the operating mechanism, just the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>
