Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department must meet or exceed the state requirements and bring the duty for enforcing them.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange.

Both include a mechanical backflow preventer - essentially, a physical barrier to the backflow. They were fantastic at fixing the clogged drain, however very very sloppy about repairing the chip in the sink and using puddy under the sink.</p>
