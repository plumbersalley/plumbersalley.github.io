However, there are lots of drawbacks to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
