<p>The Plumbing Bureau's primary focus is on safety within a structure. Plumbing inspections ensure that water systems in buildings are connected properly, with no cross-connection to infect drinkable water supply. Components need to be properly trapped, to prevent sewer gas from leaving into a buildings. Hot water heaters are likewise examined to make sure that they have actually been installed effectively, to prevent a surge.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
