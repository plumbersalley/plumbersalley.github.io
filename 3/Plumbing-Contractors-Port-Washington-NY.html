<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water supply line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household home appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary water system system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
