<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to attaching any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
