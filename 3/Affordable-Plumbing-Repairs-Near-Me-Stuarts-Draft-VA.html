Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
