<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals.
