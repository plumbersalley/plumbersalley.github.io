<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far simpler to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
