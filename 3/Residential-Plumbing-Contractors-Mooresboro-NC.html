<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow of water which might carry dirty water or other, harmful substances into the general public water system and personal plumbing. Backflow can take place in a number of situations that may draw water from places such as garden fountains, swimming pools, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water supply lines. If it is linked to any outside water source, Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of products utilized to build a waste disposal unit unit: aluminum and stainless steel.
