<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
