We can finish any necessary water softener repairs. If a complete water softener replacement should be necessary, we can do that too.

<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal unit to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then link it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>If you observe low water pressure or blemished water, it generally symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop in time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure. The staining happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health threat in your water.</p>
