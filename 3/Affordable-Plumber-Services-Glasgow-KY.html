<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
