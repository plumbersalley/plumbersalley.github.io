<p>It can take a number of weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. First, prepare for each device to be installed should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may use up to three weeks or more to process and approve. Declined plans must be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This corrosion can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable impacts on your health. Corroded pipes likewise cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
