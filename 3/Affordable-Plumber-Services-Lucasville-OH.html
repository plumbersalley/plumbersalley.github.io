<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Lucasville OH</h3>
<p>To figure out if your home is a poly house," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can likewise be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it enters the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow.
