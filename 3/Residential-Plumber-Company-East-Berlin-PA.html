<p>If you experience obstructions and backups in your home more than a few times, it's an excellent idea to have a professional examine your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system.

<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair specialist knows the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
