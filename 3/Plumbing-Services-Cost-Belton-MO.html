<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically causes the yard above it to end up being soaked. You might smell the disgusting odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (ideally shoed feet!).

<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complicated than changing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a various disposal this may be something to think about.
