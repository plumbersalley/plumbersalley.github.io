<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public water supply and personal on-site water supply and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections between potable (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of main and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow techniques supply an increased level of defense for the general public water system system.</p>
<p>When it pertains to repairing a broken or failing sewer line, there are a few alternatives. The ideal choice for your house will depend upon a few factors, including the age of your existing pipes, the degree of damage, and your budget. An approved backflow prevention device, which should be checked each year, must be installed on the service connection that the department has identified as having a potential for backflow.</p>

The policy was not strictly enforced up until a push in current years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an effort that includes regular random inspections of New york city City buildings to make sure they remain in compliance.</p>
