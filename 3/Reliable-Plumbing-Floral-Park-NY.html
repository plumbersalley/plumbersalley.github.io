<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can happen over time from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that accumulates inside of pipes. As a clog becomes larger gradually, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes appropriately.

<p>The source or area of a sewer issue identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health danger if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
