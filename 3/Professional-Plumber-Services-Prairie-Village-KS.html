<p>You probably understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your showers, bath tubs, and sinks to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working appropriately that's really all you need to learn about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what kinds of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber is available in-- they have the expertise to diagnose a problem and the tools and knowledge to fix it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
