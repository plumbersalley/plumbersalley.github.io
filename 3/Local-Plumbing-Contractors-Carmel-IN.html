<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
