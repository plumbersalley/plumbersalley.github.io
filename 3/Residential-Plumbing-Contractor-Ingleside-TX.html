Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
