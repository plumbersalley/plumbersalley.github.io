From a health perspective, these minerals have no unfavorable results and are, in truth, necessary day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that provide water the refreshing flavor many individuals find preferable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of soaps and cleaning agents.
