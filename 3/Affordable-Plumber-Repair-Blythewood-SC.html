<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for the majority of building and construction contractors (or their staff members). The key to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby removing hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This innovation is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complicated scientific procedure, but easy to correct. It utilizes salt to eliminate odors and minerals found in difficult water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that draw in and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps push hard water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>

<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if suitable).
