<p>Once the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position.

Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
