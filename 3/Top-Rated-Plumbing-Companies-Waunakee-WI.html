<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the simplest of the 3 readily available techniques. Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and need fewer repairs with time. Sanford & Boy plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. Throughout regeneration, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank.
