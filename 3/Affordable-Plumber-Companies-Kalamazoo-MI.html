<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Kalamazoo MI</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very unusual cases where the building is considered to not position a risk to the supply of water, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
