<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it as well.</p>
