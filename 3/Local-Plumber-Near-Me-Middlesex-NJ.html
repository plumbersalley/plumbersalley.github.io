<p>Remember that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you must only employ a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs capture moisture so that it does not enter the control system. Although little pieces of sediment may get through a drip leg.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when used in combating a fire. Firefighters by and big are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are interesting in safeguarding individuals's lives and to a lower extent their home. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source offered to achieve that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome suggest that the level of defense on the fire security system may need to be increased to a high threat security level.</p>
