<p>E.R. Services comprehends the significance of preserving the stability and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
