<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Troup TX</h3>
<p>When fixing the pipe is the more viable alternative, there are many circumstances. For instance, if you are experiencing a one-time water leak, fixing the problem is the better option. Nevertheless, there are lots of circumstances where a full repipe is best. So find out what has triggered the clogged gas pipe.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
