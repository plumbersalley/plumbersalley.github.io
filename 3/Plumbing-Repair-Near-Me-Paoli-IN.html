A proper and safe  work environment may entail the positioning of safety barriers or entry limitations around the work area so the repair specialist or the general public around your work area are not hurt. If the backflow preventer is set up in a restrictive area, this might impact the service technician's ability to effectively finish the repair.</p>

<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
