<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are specific pollutants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be fixed with the ideal RO system.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main drains traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is an excellent choice for most people, there are some situations where repiping is the only option. Repiping is the process of replacing old corroded pipes with lasting and resilient brand-new pipes. Since of their durability and other factors, the new pipes that are utilized are usually made of copper. Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
