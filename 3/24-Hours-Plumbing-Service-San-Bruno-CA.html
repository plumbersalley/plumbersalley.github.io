<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
