As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there should be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to watch out for excess grease and oils.
