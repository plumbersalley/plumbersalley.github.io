<p>Supply of water by the public utility consists of some amounts of harmful chemicals like arsenic and lead.

However while little drips ought to not be trigger for concern, property owners need to keep an eye on the water heater leaks. I had a terrific experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we required a leak in a pipe repaired. Tom was professional and friendly. He likewise got the job done faster than initial approximated, so the work was more economical than I expected. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
