<h3>How To Choose An Exceptional Plumbing Service Knoxville IA</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>You hear water running or dripping in the tank. When water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow occurs. The water flowing in reverse from a cross-connection might contaminate the drinking supply of water. Lawn irrigation systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis are common cross-connection points.
