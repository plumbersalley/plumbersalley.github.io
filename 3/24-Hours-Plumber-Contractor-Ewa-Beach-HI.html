<p>Many homeowners think their energy companies or property owners insurance is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the reality is that oftentimes you, the house owner, are accountable. Most fundamental property owners insurance plan and local utility companies or towns do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems in and around your home.</p>
<p>If you have actually split or broken drains up until a video inspection is performed, it's difficult to determine. Split or broken drains are normally preceded by repeating obstructions, consistent nasty drain odors or the existence of sewer flies. The initial step is attempt to clear the blocked drain and after that immediately check the drain. In many cases a smoke test can be carried out to expose breaks or fractures. ZOOM DRAIN performs a free peek video inspection with our PowerSnake and ZOOM Jetting service.</p>
