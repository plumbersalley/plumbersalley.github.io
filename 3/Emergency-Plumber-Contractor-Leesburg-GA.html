<p>The most effective way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

It is rather common to leave the old pipes in location after disconnecting them. The new pipe is simply installed in the path of least resistance. Depending on the style of your home, the pipe can be set up in the attic or under a crawl area.</p>
