<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Trenton TN</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task cleaning up after it too.</p>
