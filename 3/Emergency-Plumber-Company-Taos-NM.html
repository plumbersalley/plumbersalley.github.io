It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had great evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it also.</p>
