<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Duncan OK</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company since they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it also.</p>
