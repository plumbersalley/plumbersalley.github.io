<p>Hot water heater diagnostics: We identify what is incorrect with your hot water heater, in addition to what maintenance work needs to be carried out moving on. Water softeners typically utilize sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from dissolved sodium chloride salt, also called salt water.

<p>In reality, that's how difficult water" got its name, from the solidified mineral deposits this type of water leaves behind. Over time these deposits can collect, clog, and even wear away pipes and trigger significant plumbing problems. Hard water deposits can develop in boilers and hot water heaters, making them less effective and more expensive to use Toilets have moving parts, and moving parts wear out or break. If your toilet will not stop running, attempt fixing or replacing these key toilet parts.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
