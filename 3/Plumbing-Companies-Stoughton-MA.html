<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for the majority of building and construction contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the technology is having the ability to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This innovation is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
