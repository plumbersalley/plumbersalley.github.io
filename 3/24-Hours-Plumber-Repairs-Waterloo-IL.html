<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
