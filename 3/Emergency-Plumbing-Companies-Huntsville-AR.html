<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right now. Before you can request an inspection, you must initially get the needed permit( s) for the work you mean to do. You can check out our Permit page to find out more on acquiring an authorization. As soon as you get a license you can begin with the work. Nevertheless, you must require inspection before you hide any work or cover.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
