<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You might have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or purchase one separately at the same time for about $3.</p>
