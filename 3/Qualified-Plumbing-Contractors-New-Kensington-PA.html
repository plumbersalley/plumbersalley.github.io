<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
