<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to find.</p>
