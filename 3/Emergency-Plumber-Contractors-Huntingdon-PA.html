First, plans for each device to be installed must be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may take up to 3 weeks or more to process and authorize. Turned down plans should be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can include another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
