If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. You ought to wait up until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth. You must also check to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
