<p>A plumbing layout (strategy view) or partial layout suggesting water services, name and address of facility, water meter design, proposed backflow preventer( s), booster pump system, floor drain( s) and all nearby things (examples: electrical panels, boilers, chillers, storage tanks, fire pumps, fire sprinkler risers, etc.).

<p>If a cable television has not yet been gone to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer any time ahead of time, signing up with the cable television to the wires in the box just before or just after installing the disposer.

Products that would otherwise go in the garbage must not be placed in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, flatware), paper, anything flammable, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
