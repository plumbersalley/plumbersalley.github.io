<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He noted that there are particular contaminants that residents are handling and an RO can help ease those problems. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be treated with the right RO system.</p>
