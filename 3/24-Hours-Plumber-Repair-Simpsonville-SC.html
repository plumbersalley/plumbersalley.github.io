<p>E.R. Services understands the value of preserving the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, likewise has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. However, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't brought in to each other, how can an exchange occur? There is one other vital component required to make the procedure work: a resin bed consisting of lots of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>Examine Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you may encounter. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check even though it may be marketed as one! Don't get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI.
