<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes.

<p>The excellent news is that it does not necessarily require a repair of your entire unit if you believe your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or repaired due to their regular use. When these parts wear out, they lead to tiny leakages that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>

Anything you put down there will not go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
