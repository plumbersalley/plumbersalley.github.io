If your set just includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
