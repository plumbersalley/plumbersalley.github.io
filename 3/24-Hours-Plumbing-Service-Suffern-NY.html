<p>Water system by the water company includes some quantities of harmful chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional expenditures. A house plumbing inspection will either be visual, done with a camera, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts down, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed appropriately (Picture 8). You do not need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions except straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each location where you will have a gas appliance must have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle just, anybody who installs gas piping on home not under their ownership must have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require an authorization and inspection.</p>
