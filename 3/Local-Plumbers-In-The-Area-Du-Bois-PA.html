The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>

<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to corrode and burst when they get old.

Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized during regrowth. Finally, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
