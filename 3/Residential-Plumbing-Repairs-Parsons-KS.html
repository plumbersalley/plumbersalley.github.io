A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not position a threat to the water system, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
