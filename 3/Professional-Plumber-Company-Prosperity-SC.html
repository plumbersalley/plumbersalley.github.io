<p>As soon as the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
