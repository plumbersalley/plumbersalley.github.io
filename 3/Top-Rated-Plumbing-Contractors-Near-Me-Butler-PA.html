<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.
