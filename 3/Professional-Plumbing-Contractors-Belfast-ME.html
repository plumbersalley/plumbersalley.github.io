<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractors in Belfast</h2>

<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this certification. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
