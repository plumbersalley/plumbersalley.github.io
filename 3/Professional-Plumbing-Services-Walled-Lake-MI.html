Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
