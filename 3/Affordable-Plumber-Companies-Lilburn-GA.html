<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>For nonemergency tasks-- a remodel or restorative work on your plumbing-- you need a pro who comprehends residential-system design and knows the code in your area. He also needs to be able to work in a finished environment.
