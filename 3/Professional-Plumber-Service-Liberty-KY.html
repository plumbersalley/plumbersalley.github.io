<p>Hydro jetting is one of many trenchless services readily available to you, available through North Georgia Inliner. Hydro jetting is the use of hot, highly pressurized water through a protected hose and nozzle to clear any and all clogs.

It likewise conserves you money and time due to the fact that a 2nd inspection isn't essential.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always vulnerable to clogs with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are poured down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can produce severe drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to find and repair the concern for typical house plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it results in further damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
