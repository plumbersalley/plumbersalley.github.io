<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most obvious indications of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be).

When these parts break, they lead to tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye. This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>

When installing a brand-new toilet, the plumber may likewise need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the job.</p>
