<p>It can take numerous weeks for backflow preventer installation and compliance to be finished. Initially, plans for each device to be installed should be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which might take up to 3 weeks or more to authorize and process. Rejected strategies should be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when used in fighting a fire. Firemen by and big are not concerned with backflow prevention concerns. They are concerning with securing people's lives and to a lesser level their home. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source available to achieve that goal. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as an outcome mean that the level of protection on the fire security system might need to be increased to a high threat defense level.</p>
