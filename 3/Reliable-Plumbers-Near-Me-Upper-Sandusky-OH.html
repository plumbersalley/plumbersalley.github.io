<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity.

A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
