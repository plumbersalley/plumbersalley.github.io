<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
