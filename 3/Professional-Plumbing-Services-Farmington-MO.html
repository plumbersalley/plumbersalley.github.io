<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes.

<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts.
