<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
