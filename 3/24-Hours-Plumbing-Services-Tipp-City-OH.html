<p>Check Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers readily available that you may face. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Check although it might be marketed as one! Do not get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>

No water filter you buy can definitively get rid of lead from your drinking water.</p>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets should definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
