<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally restore after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule.</p>
