<p>Once the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut down remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly.

That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
