<h3>Leak Detection Services in West Chicago Illinois</h2>
<p>When the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut down remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
