<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when utilized in combating a fire. Firemen by and large are not worried about backflow prevention problems. They are interesting in protecting people's lives and to a lesser level their home. Getting the required volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source available to achieve that goal. This can create cross-connection control problems and might as a result suggest that the level of security on the fire security system might need to be increased to a high risk security level.</p>
