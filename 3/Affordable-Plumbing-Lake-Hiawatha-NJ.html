<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process.

However the reality is that water softening just removes solidity minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not necessity. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
