<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural stability of the system.
