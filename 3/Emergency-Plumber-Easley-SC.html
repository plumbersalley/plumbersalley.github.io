Sanford & Boy plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. Throughout regeneration, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank.

The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers enhances water's taste, however its high price tag makes it impractical as a household option.
