<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in Eldridge</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The typical service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, but steel eventually suffers from corrosion and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
