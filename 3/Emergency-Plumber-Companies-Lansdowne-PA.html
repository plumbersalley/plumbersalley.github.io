We suggest organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than products including severe chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the a lot of part, a waste disposal unit is only geared up to handle softer organic waste. It could cause it to jam and not work correctly if bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal. By running warm water through the disposal, you might have the ability to clear the clog yourself. However you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
