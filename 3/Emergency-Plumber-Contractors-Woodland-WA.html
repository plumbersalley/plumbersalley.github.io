<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the cosmetics water, backpressure is produced. This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems.

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to supply some sort of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it.

As beneficial as this gas is, the functions that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink.
