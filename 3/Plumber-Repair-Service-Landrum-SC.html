<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with known backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal system to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that link it. Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>

Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
