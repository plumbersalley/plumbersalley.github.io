<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
