<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
