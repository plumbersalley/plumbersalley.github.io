While gas designs are less expensive to operate, they do require an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electrical hot water heater is typically lower, however it can be more costly to operate. Electric ranges are also much easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
