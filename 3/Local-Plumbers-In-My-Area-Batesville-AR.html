<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

The activation of a faucet requiring hot water activates the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Due to the fact that they can hamper the blades, cooking oil and other greases ought to never ever be put down the garbage disposal. Lastly, cold water ought to be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is shut off to ensure that all food particles have actually been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
