<p>Letters are sent out to residential clients with recognized backflow gadgets on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to wear away and burst when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
