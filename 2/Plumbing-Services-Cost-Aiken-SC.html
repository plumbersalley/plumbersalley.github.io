<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Sick Of False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit must not leak. When this takes place, it generally shows wear and tear which is a reasonable sign that its time is up.
