<p>While pipe lining is a great alternative for the majority of people, there are some circumstances where repiping is the only option. Repiping is the procedure of replacing old corroded pipes with long-lasting and resilient brand-new pipes.

Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed of galvanized metals.</p>
