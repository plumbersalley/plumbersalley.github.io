<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
