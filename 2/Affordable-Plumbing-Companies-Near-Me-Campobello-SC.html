It most likely goes without stating that leaking pipes should be replaced right away. It might be normal to have condensation on warm water pipes, however it's certainly not normal for your pipes to spring a leak.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of options. The other is to proceed and replace the entire line. Absolutely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing indications of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it may be an acceptable choice to do simply that. However, if the balanced out worsens trenchless may no longer be an option.</p>
