It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage needs to likewise be provided.</p>
