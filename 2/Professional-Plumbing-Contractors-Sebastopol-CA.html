Do not attempt to locate the leak if you smell gas. Rather, leave your house or structure right away. Do not turn on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might produce a spark. Call the Peoples emergency hotline when you are in a safe place.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
