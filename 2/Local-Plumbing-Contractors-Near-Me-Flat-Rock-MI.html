<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-lived connection between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Note: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with detergent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use increasingly more cleaning agent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and sanitized during regrowth. Finally, water containing the difficult minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
