When no other source of a leak can be identified, it is safe to presume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet. For this leak, you will wish to unscrew the drain, and clean it thoroughly. If it is set in location, remove all of the previous plumber's putty by using a scraper.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to present a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative.
