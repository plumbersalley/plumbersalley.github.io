<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Leeds AL 35094?</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
