<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for up to two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
