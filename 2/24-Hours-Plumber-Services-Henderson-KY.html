<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
