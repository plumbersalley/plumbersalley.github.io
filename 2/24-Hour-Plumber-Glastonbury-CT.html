Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>
