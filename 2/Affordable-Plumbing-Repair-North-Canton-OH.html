<p>You are responsible for changing the assembly or repairing within 30 days if your assembly stops working the annual test. All replacements should be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper type of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see section below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly must meet the lead complimentary requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be discontinued until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
