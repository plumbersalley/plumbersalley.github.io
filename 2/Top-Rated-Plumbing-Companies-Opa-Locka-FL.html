<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and responsibility are incredibly crucial to building a track record for excellence.

Again, the very best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no chance to provide one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
