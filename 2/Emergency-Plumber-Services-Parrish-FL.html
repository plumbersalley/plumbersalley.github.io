Salt, the mineral that water softeners use to replace hardness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. Nevertheless, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't drawn in to each other, how can an exchange occur? There is another essential element required to make the process work: a resin bed including great deals of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>
