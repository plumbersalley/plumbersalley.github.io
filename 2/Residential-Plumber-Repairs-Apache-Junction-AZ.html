<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Unforeseen changes in water pressure might potentially be because of rust and accumulation within the pipes themselves, which narrow the passage that water can move through. You'll most likely notice lower water pressure in the shower or when washing dishes. The best service is to replace your plumbing with brand-new pipes that don't have accumulation.</p>
