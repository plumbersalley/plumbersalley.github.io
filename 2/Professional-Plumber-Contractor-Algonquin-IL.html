A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
