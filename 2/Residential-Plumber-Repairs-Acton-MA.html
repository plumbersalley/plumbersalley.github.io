<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times.

The addition of this chemical additive will require the installation of a high danger protection assembly.</p>
