<p>Toilet repair is one of the most common plumbing repairs done in homes today. This is most likely due to the truth that there are anywhere from 300 to 350 million toilets in the U.S. alone. Due to the large number of toilets, we have repaired many toilets in houses throughout the Tampa area so we are very accustomed to the products utilized and how they are set up here locally. We also have done many toilet replacements as well; this is typically called for when either a homeowner chooses to replace their toilet with perhaps a more effective one or when a toilet is just beyond repair.</p>
<p>You have actually got a problem with over-running or leaking if the sound of your toilet continuously running is normal to you. This water is being dumped down the overflow tube losing approximately 200 gallons of water daily.
