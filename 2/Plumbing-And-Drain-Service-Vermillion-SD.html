<p>The program accomplishes its mission by providing for the adoption and promulgation of suitable rules and regulations for the building of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a brand-new hot water heater. But in order to profit of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed properly. A hot water heater that is not set up properly can result in water damage, scalding temperatures, or even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
