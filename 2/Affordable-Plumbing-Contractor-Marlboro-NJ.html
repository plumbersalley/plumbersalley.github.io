<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and does not have the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
