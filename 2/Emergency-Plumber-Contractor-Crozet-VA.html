<h3>Getting Blocked Sewer Drainage Solutions in Crozet VA 22932</h3>
<p>A 2nd part of the Battelle Research study compared cleaning agent dose, water hardness, and washing temperature to see if hardness had an effect on cleaning agent cost savings. The study consisted of tests that removed hard soils, in addition to evaluating finding and shooting. Scientists found that softened water utilizes nearly 30% less cleaning agent, but cleans as well as water at 10 gpg firmness level. When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent savings rises to nearly 70%.</p>
