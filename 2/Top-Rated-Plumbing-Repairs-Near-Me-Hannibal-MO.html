<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on safety within a structure. Plumbing inspections make sure that water systems in structures are connected correctly, without any cross-connection to contaminate safe and clean water supply.

Hot water heaters are also examined to make sure that they have been set up correctly, to avoid a surge.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while.

If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
