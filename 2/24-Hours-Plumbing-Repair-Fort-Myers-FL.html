<p>While combating a fire, firefighters are understandably more worried about drawing sufficient water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any available source to attain their objective, however fire department cars frequently bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, rust inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water system and circulation pipes are commonly found with small pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is seldom utilized today for brand-new construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (often recognized simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively pricey, and difficult to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to please building regulations non-combustibility requirements generally discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications.

The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
