The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
