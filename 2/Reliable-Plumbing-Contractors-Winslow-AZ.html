<p>A Kinetico water softener will supply your family with plentiful, clean, safe water as needed. From multi-tank systems powered by the energy of moving water to a more conventional method, Kinetico covers all your options. Others bring bags of rocks for putting in your house traps or cleanouts so they are assured future blockages in the line. After the 2nd or third stoppage, they show the property owner the rocks they got rid of" from the pipe and say it must be damaged, and therefore the pipe needs to be jetted and video inspected.</p>
<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the telltale signs of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in joists, studs, and floors. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with an inferior plumber. A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
