<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult job because of the age of your home and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

Our repair procedures rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws triggered by waste buildup can prevent the liner from sticking to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to enable the water to cover the whole size of the sewer line and offer a careful cleaning.</p>
