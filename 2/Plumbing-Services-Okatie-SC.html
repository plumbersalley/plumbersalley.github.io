<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in extremely uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not posture a threat to the water supply, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
