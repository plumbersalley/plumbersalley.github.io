It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure).

<p>With PVC you have a couple of options if your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a stoppage. The other is to go on and replace the whole line. Definitely replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing signs of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate choice to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be a choice.</p>
