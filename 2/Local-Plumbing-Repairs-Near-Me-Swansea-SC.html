If this stain is an annoyance in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) advises changing to among the other two types of salts. Once the brand-new salt has had a possibility to entirely replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
