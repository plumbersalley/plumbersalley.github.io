<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily. Water softening can prevent these negative effects. Natural gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel.

If it occurs, this distinctive aroma enables you to smell a prospective leak. Always leave if you presume a leak.</p>

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions.
