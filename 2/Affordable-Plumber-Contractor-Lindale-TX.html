<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause rust that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
