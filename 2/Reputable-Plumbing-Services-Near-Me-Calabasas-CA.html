Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
