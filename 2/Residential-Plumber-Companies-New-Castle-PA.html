<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
