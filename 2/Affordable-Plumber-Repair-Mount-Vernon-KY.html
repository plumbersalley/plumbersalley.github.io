<p>Likewise called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit is available in 2 standard types - constant feed, which usually has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to operate the unit. Continuous feed is common and the simplest to use; a batch feed model is more secure but can be slower to utilize on large quantities of food waste because you have to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company supplies a summary of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
