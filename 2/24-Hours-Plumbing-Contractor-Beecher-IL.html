<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
