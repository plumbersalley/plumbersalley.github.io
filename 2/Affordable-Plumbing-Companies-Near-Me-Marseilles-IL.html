<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system.

Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
