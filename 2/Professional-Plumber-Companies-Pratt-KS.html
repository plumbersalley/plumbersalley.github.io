<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>When the pressure in a private water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can trigger regular flow to reverse, backpressure happens. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains need to be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, tub, floor and sink drains.</p>
