For example, a kitchen sink might involve as many as 6 different systems simply to supply the overall service we anticipate. Like any machine, a sink has several parts that need repair and maintenance over time.</p>

Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
