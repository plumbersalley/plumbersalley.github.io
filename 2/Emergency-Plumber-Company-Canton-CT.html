<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
