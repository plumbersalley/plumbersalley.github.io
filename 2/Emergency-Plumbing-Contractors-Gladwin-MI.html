Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly.

<p>When the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. If these connections are not correctly secured, safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system.</p>

We enjoy to provide estimates for whole home pipe replacement and financing alternatives are available for big jobs. A pressure vacuum breaker performs the same function as an atmospheric vacuum breaker, but needs just one system to safeguard the entire water supply when mounted on the main water line.</p>
