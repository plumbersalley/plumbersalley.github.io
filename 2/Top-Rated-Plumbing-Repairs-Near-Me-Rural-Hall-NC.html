We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
