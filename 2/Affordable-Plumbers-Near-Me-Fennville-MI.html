<p>Strange Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it hard for the water to pass through. Because of the tight area, the pipes typically make unusual gurgling sounds as water attempts to go through a clogged pipe.

Often handles are toilet parts that get rusty or loose and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down effectively. It's an easy repair, however there's a trick to getting the flush handle out. The keeping nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Image 1). Then get rid of the old handle and lever, slide the new manage into location, and thread on the keeping nut. Tighten by turning to the right (Image 2).</p>
