<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Milford OH</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>
