When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal proof that certain magnetic and electromagnetic gadgets can be efficient in avoiding scale development in difficult water systems. It is very hard to evaluate such claims, which are almost never ever based on tests that are well sufficient explained to enable others to evaluate them and to confirm the results.
