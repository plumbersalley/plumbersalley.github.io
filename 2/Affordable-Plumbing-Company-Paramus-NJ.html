<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Paramus NJ</h3>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," start with the outside. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it enters the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to completion of the water main. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Toilets are hard things to know. They've been constructed pretty much the exact same way for hundreds of years, so you can't truly tell how old they are. It may not work extremely well all the time, however you can't tell if that's typical or not. Plus, there's that universal but never unacknowledged sensation that it's you-you're somehow doing something incorrect in there.</p>
