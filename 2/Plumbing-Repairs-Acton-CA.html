<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
