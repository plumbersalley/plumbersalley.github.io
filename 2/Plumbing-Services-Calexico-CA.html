Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed due to the fact that of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
