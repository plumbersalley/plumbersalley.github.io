<p>Backflow is a possible issue in a water system due to the fact that it can spread infected water back through a circulation system. For instance, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any prospective or actual connection in between the public supply of water and a source of contamination or contamination) can enable impurities or pollutants to enter the potable water supply. Illness can result from ingesting water that has actually been polluted due to backflow.</p>

Poorly installed P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>
