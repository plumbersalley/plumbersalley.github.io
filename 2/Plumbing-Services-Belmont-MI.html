<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
