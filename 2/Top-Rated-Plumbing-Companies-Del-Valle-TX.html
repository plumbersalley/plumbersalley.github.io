<p>Check the house's hot water heater You will be aiming to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a family of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Examine to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and offered for use. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. Request that a brand-new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of deterioration.</p>

<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
