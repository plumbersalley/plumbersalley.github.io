Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural integrity of the system.

Incorrect installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to discover.</p>
