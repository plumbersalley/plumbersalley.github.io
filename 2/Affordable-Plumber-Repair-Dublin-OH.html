<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening merely gets rid of solidity minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. This large quantity of trash does not need to enter the garbage can if it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hindering water flow. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent to land fills and other dumping locations. With a garbage disposal the trash is handled through already existing water facilities.</p>

Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
