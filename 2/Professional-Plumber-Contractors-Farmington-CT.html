<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids impurities or contaminants from being drawn into the drinking water supply. Many sprinkling systems already have the correct backflow preventer installed and need just be evaluated yearly. Others might not meet state and local guidelines and may need to be replaced with the proper backflow preventer.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
