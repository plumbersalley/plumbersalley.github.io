<p>Gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the decomposing of organic matters like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the functions that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make certain to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
