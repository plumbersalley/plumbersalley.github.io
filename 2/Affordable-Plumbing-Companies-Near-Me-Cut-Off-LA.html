<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter season freezing. The new pipe, made from a modern, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall product are removed to connect the pipes to the water components, Wood says. Depending upon the scope of work being performed and the type of building, you might have several inspections.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>Backpressure occurs when the pressure in a private water system goes beyond the pressure in the public water distribution lines that can cause normal flow to reverse. A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a building's plumbing system to reach a greater floor may trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be carried out on all drains, including toilet, tub, sink and floor drains.</p>
