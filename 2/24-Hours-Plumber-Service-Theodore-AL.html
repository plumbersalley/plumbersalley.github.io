<p>The electrical and plumbing work involved in garbage disposal installation make the task possibly dangerous. That makes it an excellent reason to work with a professional plumber to install or replace your disposal. Property owners can either acquire the new disposal themselves and supply it to the professional for installation, or let the plumber purchase the disposal on their behalf and include it in the total cost.</p>
<p>Toilet flush manages are another part of a toilet that can trigger toilets to keep running. Frequently handles are toilet parts that get loose or corroded and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down appropriately. It's a simple repair, but there's a technique to getting the flush handle out. The keeping nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen (Picture 1). Then remove the old handle and lever, slide the new handle into place, and thread on the maintaining nut. Tighten by turning to the right (Photo 2).</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
