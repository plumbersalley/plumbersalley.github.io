<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
