<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the product. To maintain your health, safety, and house convenience, we use just the very best piping: polyethylene.
