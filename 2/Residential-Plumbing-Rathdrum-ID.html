<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the wallet of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department should fulfill or go beyond the state requirements and carry the duty for imposing them.</p>
<p>If you observe low water pressure or blemished water, it typically signifies rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure. The discoloration happens when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water supply, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can end up being a health hazard in your water.</p>
