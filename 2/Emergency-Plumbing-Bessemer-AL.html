<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Bessemer AL</h3>
<p>The most effective method to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If the sound of your toilet constantly running is typical to you, then you've got a problem with over-running or leaking. This water is being dumped down the overflow tube wasting as much as 200 gallons of water each day. That takes a toll on your water bill, not to mention the danger of a more major leak that could ruin your house with flooding.</p>
