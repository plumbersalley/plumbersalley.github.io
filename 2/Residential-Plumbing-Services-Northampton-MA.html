<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.
