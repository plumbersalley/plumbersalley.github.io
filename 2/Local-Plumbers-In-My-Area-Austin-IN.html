Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, specifically in older neighborhoods where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly intensified if pipes have actually been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>Don't put everything down your garbage disposal. It is necessary to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and potentially cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also cause clogs and jams - consider composting or placing these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can harden and gather in your drain also. After completing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>
