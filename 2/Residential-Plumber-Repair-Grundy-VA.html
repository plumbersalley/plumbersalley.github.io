<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

Some homeowners will try to remove the clog utilizing store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, specifically if you are handling a small drain clog. However, they are generally temporary fixes that do not offer long-term resolutions.</p>
