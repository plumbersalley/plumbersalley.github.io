Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
