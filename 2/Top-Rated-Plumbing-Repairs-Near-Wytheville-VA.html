<p>Aside from these 2 essential elements, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
