But while small drips should not be trigger for concern, house owners ought to watch on the water heater leaks. I had a terrific experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we needed a leak in a pipe repaired. Tom was friendly and professional.

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
