Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the drinkable water system within a building these gadgets are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to perform site inspections to determine if a backflow prevention device is required as an outcome of a prospective or real cross-connection threat on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections located on Vashon Island are just performed on Wednesdays. Area Repairs: Using one or a mix of the above services, we will fix the problems we discover with the camera inspection directly without uprooting any more than we have to.</p>
