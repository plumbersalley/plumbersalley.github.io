<p>Some producers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
