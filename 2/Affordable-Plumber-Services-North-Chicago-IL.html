<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you must probably not put into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
