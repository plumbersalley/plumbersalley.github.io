Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging job since of the age of your home and place of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
