<p>Check Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers offered that you may face. The first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the very same thing as a Double Check although it might be marketed as one! Do not get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
