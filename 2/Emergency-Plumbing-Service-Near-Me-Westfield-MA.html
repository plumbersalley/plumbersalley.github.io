<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller design that operated on the exact same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
