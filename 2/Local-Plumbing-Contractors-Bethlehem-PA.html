Which is why choosing a comfy, reliable toilet seat is exceptionally important. However, you need to ensure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It really isn't a great idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been specifically developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or will not disperse your weight equally and might ultimately cause fractures in the bowl.</p>
