<p>The most effective method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Sinks aren't as easy as they used to be. Nowadays, house owners can pick from an excessive series of sinks for the kitchen, bath, damp bar, energy room, and more.
