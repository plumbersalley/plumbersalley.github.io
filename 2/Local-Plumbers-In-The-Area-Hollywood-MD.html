<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
