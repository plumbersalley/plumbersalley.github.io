<p>If you have actually always resided in an area with tough water, you might not understand how much it impacts you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from hard water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of shampoos and soaps, triggering you to utilize more.
