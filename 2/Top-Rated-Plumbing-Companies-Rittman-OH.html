Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
