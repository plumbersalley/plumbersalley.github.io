Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed.
