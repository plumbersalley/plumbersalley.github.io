<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor understands the indicators of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in studs, joists, and floorings. Finally, a quality contractor will not threat working with an inferior plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
