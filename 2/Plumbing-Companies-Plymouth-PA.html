<p>While battling a fire, firemens are understandably more worried about drawing sufficient water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they use water from any offered source to attain their goal, however fire department vehicles often carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing agents.</p>
