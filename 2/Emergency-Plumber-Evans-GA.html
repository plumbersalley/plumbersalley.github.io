<p>The conventional hot water heater has a tank that is filled with continuously heated water. It loses energy by holding the temperature level of water that is not currently in use. Unlike residential pools, public or community pools should use only RP devices or Air Gaps on their refill lines. An RP on a public or neighborhood pool must be evaluated upon installation and after that annually.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
