<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Latrobe PA</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio house carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and elements. To avoid rust from rust, storage tanks are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod secures the tank by drawing in destructive materials. By having the anode rod inspected frequently and replaced as needed, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>
