<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
