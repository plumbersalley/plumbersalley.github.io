<p>There's an excellent possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This corrosion can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of negative impacts on your health. Rusty pipes likewise lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>If you've ever been frustrated by cloudy white spots on your dishes that will not disappear, white t-shirts that turn gray and dull after a few washes, or a stubborn layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll enjoy to know that water softening can remove these problems and more. Hard water triggers these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to worry about any concerns with mineral deposits staying. This makes tasks simpler and less frustrating for everybody included.</p>
