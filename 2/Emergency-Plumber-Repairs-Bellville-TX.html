<p>Nevertheless, there is one Do It Yourself task that isn't fundamental and is best delegated the specialists: sewer line repair Sewer repairs can quickly become complex when handled by someone with little to no experience in plumbing. While it may appear like a job worth taking on, there are a number of factors to avoid taking a Do It Yourself approach to a sewer line repair job and rather pick to work with a licensed, professional plumber.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>

Broken toilet? No problem for our extremely trained plumbers.
