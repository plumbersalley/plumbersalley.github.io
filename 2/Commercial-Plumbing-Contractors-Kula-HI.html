<p>Recommendations: A skilled plumbing company must be able to provide you the names of recent clients in your part of town. It can take a DIYer a great deal of time to find and total easy repairs, so think about that with the cost when attempting to manage the issue by yourself. The factor a toilet will not flush could be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain underneath the toilet can also be the cause. Working with a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your initial step; a plumber can identify the issue and repair it.</p>
