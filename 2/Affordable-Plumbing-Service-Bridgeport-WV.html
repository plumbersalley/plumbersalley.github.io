<p>Turn the manage counterclockwise if it ends up being difficult to turn; it's likely you've come across a blockage. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of debris. Place it back into the drain until you hit resistance once again, then turn the handle back and forth to work a few of the clog free. Pull the auger out occasionally to get rid of debris till it moves past the blockage without resistance.</p>
<p>When a natural gas line is burst, it immediately ends up being a severe security hazard.

<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
