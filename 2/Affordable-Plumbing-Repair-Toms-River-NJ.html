<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Toms River NJ</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
