<p>Before the repair service technician begins the repair process, he must be sure he has actually examined the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any restrictive conditions. Appropriate safety precautions should be followed for correct entry if the area is thought about a confined area. A appropriate and safe  workplace might require the positioning of security barricades or entry restrictions around the work area so the repair service technician or the general public around your workspace are not damaged. If the backflow preventer is set up in a restrictive area, this could impact the professional's capability to effectively complete the repair.</p>
