Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
