During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Bordentown NJ</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
<p>Water treated with a water softener system may not only save customers cash but might likewise be environmentally friendly, due to the fact that it helps cut back on hazardous cleaning agents entering into water streams. In locations where there is very tough water, customers can often cut cleaning agent use in dishwashing machines and washing makers by more than 50% after softening and get the exact same outcomes.</p>
