Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, ensure the new waste disposal unit installation set consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
