<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The average toilet will last for decades and have minimal problems that can be easily repaired without replacement. Nevertheless, when it is time for toilet replacement, it is essential to have a skilled and licensed  plumber manage the task.

Whether you need a brand-new toilet for a bathroom remodel, moving into a brand-new house, or simply wanting to update your current toilet, we ensure that our installation process will not harm your house or its plumbing system.</p>
