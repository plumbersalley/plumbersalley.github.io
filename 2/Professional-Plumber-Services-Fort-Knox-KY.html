<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

<p>Wondering how much do plumbers charge to snake a drain? While each case of a clogged drain is different to the next, here are some rough estimates on what a plumber cost to snake a drain is.
