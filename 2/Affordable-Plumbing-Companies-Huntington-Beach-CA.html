<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but rarely stop to consider. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck.

<p>Damage control is a problem. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I encounter scenarios, on a regular basis that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. In some cases, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not safely get in the basement and run up until the sewage is drawn out and the basement is usually cleaned up. I 'd enjoy to publish some pictures of this. Simply search line. The problem does exist.</p>
