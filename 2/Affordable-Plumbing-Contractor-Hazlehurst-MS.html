<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water passing through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
