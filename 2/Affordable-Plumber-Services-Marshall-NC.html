<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see however hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Attempt releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>

Other excellent choices are overload protection, which shuts off the motor if it starts to overheat; an auto-reverse feature to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your home is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly created to be used with a septic tank. gives an introduction 1 of garbage disposals and septic systems.</p>
