<p>The very best way to handle high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities site is by installing a pressure lowering valve (PRV). A PRV will control water pressure as it enters the house.

<p>Inside the house, inspect the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leakages or drips. Inspect beneath sinks to check for leaking pipes. Local plumber quoted cost of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ pleased I examined around. Under the sink, put a container or pan beneath the drain, then use locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>You ought to constantly drip cold water into the waste disposal unit while squashing foods. Cold water sets greases that have been poured in. This makes it smoother for the system to shred them. A lot of hardware stores bring gasket sets for sink drains and disposals. Included in these are directions for installation. It's fast and easy and cheaper than working with a plumber.</p>
