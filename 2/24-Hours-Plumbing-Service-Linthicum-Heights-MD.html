<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a very important part of the design of each part. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
