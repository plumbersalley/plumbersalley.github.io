<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
