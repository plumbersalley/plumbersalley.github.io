Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leakages are among the most common signs that your system is at the end of its lifespan, particularly if they are causing significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>

After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
