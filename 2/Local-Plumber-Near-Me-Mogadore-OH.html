You may need to switch toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is relatively new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing info. Examine the list of state licensing agencies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise maintains a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
