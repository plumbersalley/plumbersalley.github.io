<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the major offenders. They harden to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls as well. Even tree roots can produce major drain blockages by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to find and repair the concern for regular house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is happening to your home.</p>
