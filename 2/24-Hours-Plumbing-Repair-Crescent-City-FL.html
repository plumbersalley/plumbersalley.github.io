<p>The great news is that it doesn't always require a repair of your whole unit if you suspect your toilet has a leak. A toilet's tank is composed of numerous small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be changed or fixed due to their frequent use. When these parts break, they result in small leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you suspect you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>
