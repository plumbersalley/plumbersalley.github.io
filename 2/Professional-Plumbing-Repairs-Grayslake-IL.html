<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
