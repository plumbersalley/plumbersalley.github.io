<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic man. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. If the water shuts down, you might have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's changed appropriately (Image 8). You do not have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
