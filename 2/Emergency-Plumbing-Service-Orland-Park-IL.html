This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening merely eliminates hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
