<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Wharton NJ</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
