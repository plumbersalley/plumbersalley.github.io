When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, clay, copper or plastic, will identify the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
<p>However, the majority of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the pocketbook of a homeowner.
