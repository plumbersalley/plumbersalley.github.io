<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
