<p>Surface Area Accelerated Formation is an invention that imitates biomineralization, the system typically acknowledged for structured growth in the environment, consisting of seashells. Water softening is achieved with SACr by using exclusive polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates.
