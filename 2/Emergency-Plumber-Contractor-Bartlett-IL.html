<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Bartlett IL</h3>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
