<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus offers you an optional Pipe Security Plan for only $3.95 a month.

<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates professional inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is manually manipulated on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the service technician to accurately examine conditions and identify the performance of the pipes. The information we glean from the inspection allows us to make an informed decision relating to the condition of your pipes and advise the very best option as well.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
