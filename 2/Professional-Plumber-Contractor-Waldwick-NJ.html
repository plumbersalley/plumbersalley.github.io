<p>It is common for water heaters to leak due to varying pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve is part of the system for that precise factor. But while small drips need to not be cause for concern, homeowners ought to watch on the water heater leakages.

<p>Disadvantages to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Also, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
