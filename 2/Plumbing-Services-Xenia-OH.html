Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite instructions.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers enhances water's taste, but its high price makes it impractical as a household option.

<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be changed if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the house.</p>
