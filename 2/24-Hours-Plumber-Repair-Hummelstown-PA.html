<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Hummelstown PA</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to resolve tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners normally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last a lot longer if they are appropriately preserved. Making sure the brine tank never runs out of salt will extend the system's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise safeguard the unit. Iron will nasty the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners enhance the regeneration cycle and aid relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
