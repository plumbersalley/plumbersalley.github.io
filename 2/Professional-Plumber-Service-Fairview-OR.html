It's so old that it is no longer able to push water through the toilet to completely clear the drain. This results in your toilet having a constant blocking issue.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
<p>It is necessary that all aspects of your gas lines remain in excellent condition. The state of the pipe is necessary. As is the connection to your device and equipment. If any of these are a problem, there is the potential for gas leakages and even fire. When a Notice of Correction" or Notice of Requirement" is provided, failure to install or remedy an installation and then check a backflow assembly might result in service disturbance or termination.</p>
