<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or purchasing an older home.</p>

Another idea to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
