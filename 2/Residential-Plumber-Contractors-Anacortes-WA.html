<p>Our group at All Phase Plumbing likewise uses drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a long lasting and outstanding option for your broken pipes. The pipe lining process includes our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is entirely saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and cracks. The liner is left to harden in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. When the procedure is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be examined one more time to ensure your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
