<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
