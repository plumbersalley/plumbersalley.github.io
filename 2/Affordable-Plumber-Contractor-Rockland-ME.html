<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>Other than for domestic pump and pump and irrigation systems, certification is not needed to install plumbing systems beyond a structure (e.g., water lines connected directly to local water pipe, sewer line connections, etc.).
