Water pressure may stop working or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
