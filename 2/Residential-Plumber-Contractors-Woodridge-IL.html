<p>When a gas line is burst, it instantly ends up being a serious safety threat.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool manufacturer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done separately. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for approximately two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
