As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.

Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
