<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Due to the fact that it is a large task that is typically perceived as an unneeded cost, many property owners prevent repiping their houses. Why repipe your home when fixing it is possible?

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
