<p>Downsides to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
