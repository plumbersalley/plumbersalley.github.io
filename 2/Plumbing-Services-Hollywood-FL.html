<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Hollywood FL</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Was your home developed before the 1970s and has not undergone renovation or pipe replacement? If so, it is likely that your pipes are made from galvanized metal or another material which has actually corroded and decayed throughout the years. Older pipes can cause significant leakages and even infect your water as they decay. Even the greatest quality pipes won't last permanently and will need to be changed.</p>
