<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Don't put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is very important to enjoy what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially cause a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger obstructions and jams - consider composting or positioning these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can harden and gather in your drain too. After completing cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
