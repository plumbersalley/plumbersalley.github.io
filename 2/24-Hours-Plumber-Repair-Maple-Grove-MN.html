<p>The most efficient method to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>If you have your water tested, the report will use one or both of these units to inform you how hard your water is. Given that the level of calcium carbonate indicates little to water consumers, water experts have classified levels of firmness. Table 1 shows these categories. Double Check Valve assemblies are the most typical type used on watering systems in Horseshoe Bay.</p>
