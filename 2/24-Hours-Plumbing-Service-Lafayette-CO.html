<p>To identify if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main turned off is attached to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, referred to as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them operating effectively. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality.
