After the process is complete, you wind up with soft water that has sodium in it but no other minerals.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
