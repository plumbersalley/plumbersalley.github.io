<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Chevy Chase MD 20815?</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
