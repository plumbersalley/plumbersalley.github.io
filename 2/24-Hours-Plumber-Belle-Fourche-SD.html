<p>If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span.

Corroded pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Mechanical water softening units are for that reason also called ion exchange water softeners. The best method to clear a clogged drain without harming your pipes and plumbing system is to call a trusted local plumber at ABC.
