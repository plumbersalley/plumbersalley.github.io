Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you usually understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. Nevertheless, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is probably in the draining fixture itself. Blockages in a fixture can cause destructive damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>
