If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Among the important things we concentrate on is the bathroom toilet. Many people and services let the toilet drainage every year with leaking or inefficient models.
