It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
