<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
