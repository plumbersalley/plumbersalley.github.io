If your home was developed prior to the 1970s, we strongly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. If your home was built decades before that, opportunities are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at optimal rates.</p>
