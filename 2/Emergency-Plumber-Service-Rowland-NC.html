<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a few things worth knowing about waste disposal unit installation.

Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise trigger clogs and jams - think about composting or positioning these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can congeal and gather in your drain also. After finishing cooking, consider putting remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or quickly location in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

That means putting down a piece of scrap carpeting to secure floors and cutting exact, easy-to-repair holes in walls, and, then, just when essential.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
