<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>However, you also need to think about the age of your unit. If your system is getting close to ten years old, it's generally not smart to spend for repairs if they deserve more than 50 percent of the price of a brand-new unit. It is encouraged that you have the garbage disposal replaced if problems end up being more frequent with an older system.
