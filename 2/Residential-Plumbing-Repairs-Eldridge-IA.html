It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
