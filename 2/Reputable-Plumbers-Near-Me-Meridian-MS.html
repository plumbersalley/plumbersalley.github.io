<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Meridian MS</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>
