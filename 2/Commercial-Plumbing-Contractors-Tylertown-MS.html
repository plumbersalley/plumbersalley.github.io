There is a leak somewhere and this might be major problem if it is. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in your home should have water. This goes for every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to an excellent start if whatever is working properly.</p>
<p>Area - The amount of excavation that requires to be done to connect to city water and sewer lines will impact the cost.
