<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Lake Orion MI</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>Strainers are recommended prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire fighting water lines. No strainer is to be utilized in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction. In this post we take a look at plumbers vs. plumbing contractors and specialized plumbers. RPZ backflow systems, on the other hand, have valves that just open when water is streaming forward.</p>
