<p>It's at the end of its natural life and you're better off getting a new one if your hot water tank is over 15 years old. Turn on the shower in the room farthest from the home's water source.

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a practical service, specifically when basic plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and household.</p>
