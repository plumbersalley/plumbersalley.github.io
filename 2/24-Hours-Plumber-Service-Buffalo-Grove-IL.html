It is extremely hard to evaluate such claims, which are nearly never based on tests that are well adequate described to allow others to examine them and to verify the results. While the absence of "scientific" proof does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it needs to make one think twice to accept it without some guarantee of performance.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
