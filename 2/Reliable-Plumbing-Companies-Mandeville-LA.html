<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>We suggest that property owners buy cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber a minimum of once per year to clean out the drains and keep whatever running efficiently.
