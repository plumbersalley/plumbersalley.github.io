<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter freezing. The new pipe, made from a modern, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall product are gotten rid of to connect the pipes to the water components, Wood states. Depending on the scope of work being performed and the type of building, you might have several inspections.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
