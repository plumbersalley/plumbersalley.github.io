<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regenerate after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
