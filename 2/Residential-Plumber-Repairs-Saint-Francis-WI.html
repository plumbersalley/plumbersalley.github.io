<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated service of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
