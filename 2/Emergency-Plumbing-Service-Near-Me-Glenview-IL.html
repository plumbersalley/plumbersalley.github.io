<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Glenview IL</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly unusual cases where the building is deemed to not position a threat to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
