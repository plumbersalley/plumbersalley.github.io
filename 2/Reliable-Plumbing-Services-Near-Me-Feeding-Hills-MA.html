<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this large amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can.

By installing a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by conserving the quantity of garbage that gets sent to garbage dumps and other discarding areas. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>

Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
