<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
