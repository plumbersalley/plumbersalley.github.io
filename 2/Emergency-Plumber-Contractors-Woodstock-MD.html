High energy bills? It may be time for a new warm water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed appropriately. A hot water heater that is not set up correctly can result in water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>

It also hinders soap and cleaning agent usage. People with extremely soft water can use smaller quantities of soap and detergent for washing.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
