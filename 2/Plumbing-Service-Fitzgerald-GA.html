<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can break or deteriorate.

You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst.

While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
