<p>Hot water heater diagnostics: We determine what is wrong with your hot water heater, along with what maintenance work needs to be performed moving on. Water softeners typically use sodium (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are provided from liquified sodium chloride salt, likewise called salt water. In the ion exchange process, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like wet sand.</p>
<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can happen with time from the accumulation of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects within pipes. As a clog becomes larger in time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes properly. You can combat hard water in various ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
