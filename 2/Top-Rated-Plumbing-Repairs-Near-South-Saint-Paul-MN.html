<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Water could be dripping onto the pilot burner flame. A leaking tank is a factor to call a water heater expert right away.
