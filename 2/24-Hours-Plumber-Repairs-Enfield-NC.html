It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
<p>Is your house 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary product utilized in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it typically succumbs to rust after about 50 years and needs replacement. Even more contemporary pipes won't last permanently, so watch on plumbing systems that might be reaching completion of their life expectancy.</p>
