If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
