<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Soft water is readily available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, even throughout regeneration. Running toilets can be the outcome of a rusty overflow pipe, broken flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Offer the specialists at Roto-Rooter a call to repair your running toilet and reduce lost water. Backflow prevention systems are devices set up onto a pipe that only allow water to flow in one direction.</p>
