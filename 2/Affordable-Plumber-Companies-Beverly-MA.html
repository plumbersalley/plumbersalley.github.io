<p>Sewer lines have one important function: bring wastewater out of a home or building. Most folks replace their hot water heater due to poor efficiency, total failure or as a preventive measure.

As beneficial as this gas is, the functions that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that hazard, mercaptans are included into gas, which offers it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking.
