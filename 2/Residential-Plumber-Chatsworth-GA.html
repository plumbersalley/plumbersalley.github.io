<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical solution, especially when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
