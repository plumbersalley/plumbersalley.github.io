<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
