Sediment Build-Up: If you notice unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has developed in your tank, and is causing a reaction with the heating element. Lacking hot water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
