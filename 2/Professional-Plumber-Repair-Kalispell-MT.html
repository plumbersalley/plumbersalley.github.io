Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
