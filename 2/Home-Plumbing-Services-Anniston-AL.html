<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
