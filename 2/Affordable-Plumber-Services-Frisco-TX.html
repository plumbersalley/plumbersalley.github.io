<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly. Water softening can prevent these unfavorable impacts. Natural gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a safety precaution, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas an odor frequently associated with rotten eggs. This unique aroma permits you to smell a prospective leak if it takes place. If you believe a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an essential part of your home or organisation, and its ability to function is necessary. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this might be an indication of a bigger issue, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog. If the drains clog sometimes however you can typically flush them out, this may be a smaller sized clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Small obstructions can develop into huge ones fairly rapidly.</p>

Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
