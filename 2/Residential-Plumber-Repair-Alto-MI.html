<p>Weird Sounds - If unusual gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably requires a thorough cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to pass through. Due to the fact that of the tight area, the pipes frequently make strange gurgling sounds as water efforts to pass through a clogged pipe.

<p>If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This deterioration can cause a buildup of lead, which can have numerous negative effects on your health. Corroded pipes likewise result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can easily be fixed by replacing that area of damaged piping. However, when the problem is discovered in pipes throughout your house, it may be time to consider whole-house repiping. Few house owners are thrilled with the idea of changing all their pipes, however dealing with the job prior to the plumbing system fails permits you to prevent considerable property damage.</p>
