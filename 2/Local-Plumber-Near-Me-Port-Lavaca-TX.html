<p>Many homeowner install gas lines for gas ranges, heating systems, fireplaces or other gas operable appliances in the home. Gas lines deliver the natural energy source to the home safely.

<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
