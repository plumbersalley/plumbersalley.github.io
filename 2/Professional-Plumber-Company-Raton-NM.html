Low water pressure could be due to a wide range of elements, but the most common factors are sediment accumulation and deterioration, which both block water from passing through the whole pipe and put unwanted pressure on specific areas of pipe.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
