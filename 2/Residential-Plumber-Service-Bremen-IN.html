<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Shortened to TAC, this technique utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where firmness mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline kind that will not hold on to surface areas. These crystals are microscopic and flow generally through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need continuous regrowth.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly starts. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
