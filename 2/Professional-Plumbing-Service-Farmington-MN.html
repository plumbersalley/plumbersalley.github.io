When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to travel through.

This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the unusual sounds originating from your sink.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be resistant to root intrusion for up to 100 years.</p>
