<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
