<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, ensure the brand-new garbage disposal installation kit includes a tube, or buy one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
