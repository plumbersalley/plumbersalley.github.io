<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and eliminates from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
