Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
