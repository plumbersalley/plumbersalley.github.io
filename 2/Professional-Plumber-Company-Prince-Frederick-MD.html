Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
