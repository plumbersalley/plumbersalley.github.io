<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for the majority of building and construction contractors (or their workers). The key to the innovation is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
