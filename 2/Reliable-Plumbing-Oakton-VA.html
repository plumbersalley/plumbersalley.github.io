Finally, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and must continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is switched off to guarantee that all food particles have actually been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
<p>Though it's not always necessary, sometimes the plumber may have to repair or upgrade electrical wiring to power the new garbage disposal. This generally costs an extra $50 to $100+.
