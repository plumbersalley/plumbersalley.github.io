<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant contributor to the hardness of Woodbury's water. Due to the fact that it forms a white powder residue when all the water vaporizes, solidity can appear as a nuisance when water is boiled or dried from a drip.
