<p>Gently lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed properly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate precautions.</p>
