<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
