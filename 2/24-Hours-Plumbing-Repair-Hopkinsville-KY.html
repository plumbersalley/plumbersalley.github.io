<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for a lot of building contractors (or their workers). The secret to the innovation is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thus eliminating hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
