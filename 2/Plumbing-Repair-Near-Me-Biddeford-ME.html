<p>The most effective method to resolve tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>We assist with every kind of hot water heater maintenance, repair, and installation. Our plumbers will never suggest more than you need and will always consider your home's requirements, your unique preferences, and your spending plan.
