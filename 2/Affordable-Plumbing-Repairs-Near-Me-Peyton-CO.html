<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
