The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge.

When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
