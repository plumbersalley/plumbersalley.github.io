<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
