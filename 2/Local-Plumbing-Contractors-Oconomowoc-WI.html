<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and eliminates from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
