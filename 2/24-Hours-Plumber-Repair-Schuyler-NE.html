<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close appropriately. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
