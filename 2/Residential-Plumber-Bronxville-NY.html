<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Testing & Repair in Bronxville New York</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the public supply of water and private on-site water system and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of secondary and main backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow approaches supply an increased level of protection for the public supply of water system.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
