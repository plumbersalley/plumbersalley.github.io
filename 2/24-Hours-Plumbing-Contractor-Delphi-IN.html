<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow of water which may bring unclean water or other, harmful compounds into the public water supply and private plumbing. Backflow can occur in a number of situations that may draw water from locations such as garden fountains, pool, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also bring water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>Carefully raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Tankless water heaters are typically called on-demand water heaters. These water heating unit create hot water as it is needed by heating the water that streams from your water pipe to your tap, bypassing the need for a tank. A tankless water heater typically costs less to operate over its lifetime, but typically costs more upfront than tank hot water heater. Depending upon your needs, you may need more than one tankless water heater to satisfy your everyday hot water needs.</p>
