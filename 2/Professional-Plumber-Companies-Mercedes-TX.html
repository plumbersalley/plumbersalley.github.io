<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>

<p>You need to spend at least $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient surface and a reliable stopper mechanism. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be annoying. The twist-and-drop design is a lot easier to use but needs occasional -ring replacement.</p>
