<p>Particles such as foreign things - Items such as soap, hair, food and even small toys can become trapped between your drain and your pipes. These will ultimately block the circulation of your water prior to causing a clog. Likewise, if excessive toilet paper is flushed down your toilet, or sanitary items are flushed, a clog can happen. Thermostat concerns: The thermostat manages the temperature level of the hot water heater. You may be left with water that is scalding hot or freezing cold if this element breakdowns.</p>
