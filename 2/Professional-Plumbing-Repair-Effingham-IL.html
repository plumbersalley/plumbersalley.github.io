<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>The sink is a main feature of bathrooms and kitchen areas and are vulnerable to getting clogged drains. When this plumbing fixture is not running correctly, having a clogged sink or a leaking sink gets in the way of your household routine and triggers a major trouble. Sometimes you may need to replace your whole sink and our technicians are prepared to help you with sink installation in addition to our sink repair services.</p>
