<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the structure; extra, more considerable costs can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for locals. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>

Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's changed effectively (Photo 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
