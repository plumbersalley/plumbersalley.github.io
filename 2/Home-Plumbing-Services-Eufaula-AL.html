<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Eufaula AL</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
