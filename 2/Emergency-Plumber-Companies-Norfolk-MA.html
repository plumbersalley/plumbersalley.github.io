<h3>How To Pick Good 24 Hour Emergency Plumbers For Pipe Video Inspections Norfolk MA</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had excellent evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
