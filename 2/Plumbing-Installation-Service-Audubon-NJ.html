<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your lawn. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are set up in locations where the ambient temperature is maintained at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high risk protection assembly.</p>
