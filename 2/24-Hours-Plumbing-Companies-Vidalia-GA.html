<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Vidalia GA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
