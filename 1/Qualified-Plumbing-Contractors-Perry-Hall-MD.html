You do not need a plumbing authorization for basic repairs such as unclogging a sink or if a plumbing license is provided as part of a larger residential building authorization or commercial structure authorization.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing License and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause pipes to lose pressure.

<p>When a plumbing authorization has been released in mistake because of inaccurate, incomplete or inaccurate details, or the work for which the authorization was released violates the Uniform Code, such authorization will be withdrawed or suspended till such time as the authorization holder shows that all work finished and all work proposed will be in compliance with appropriate provisions of the code.</p>
