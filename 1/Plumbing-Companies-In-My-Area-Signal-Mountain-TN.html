<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Signal Mountain TN</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
