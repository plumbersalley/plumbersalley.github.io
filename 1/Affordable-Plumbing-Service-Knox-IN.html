<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that avoids impurities or pollutants from being drawn into the drinking water system. Lots of sprinkling systems already have the correct backflow preventer installed and need just be checked every year. Others might not fulfill state and local policies and might need to be replaced with the proper backflow preventer.</p>

The discoloration happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
