<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it may require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
