<p>When the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might occur.

If these connections are not correctly safeguarded, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting approach is utilized on pipes that are severely damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing bigger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline.

As it makes its method through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
