<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both inside your home and underground, DCVs are a bit more expensive but are likewise highly practical, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically. Video cameras work in finding buried septic tanks or checking the condition of buried pipes to figure out appropriate maintenance schedules or the degree of needed repairs.

<p>One typical method for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue might spread out tremendously if that infected water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in private homes, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and contaminating the general public water supply.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic methods of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
