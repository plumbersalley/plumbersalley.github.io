He was then able to eliminate the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The consumer assisted our specialist in moving the toilet back into its correct location, and the service technician tightened the bolts prior to restoring the water system and making sure that the toilet was correctly flushing.</p>

Pumps press tough water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
