<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Milton VT</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is usually maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
