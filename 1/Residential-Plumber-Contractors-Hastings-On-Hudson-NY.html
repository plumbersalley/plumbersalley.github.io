Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
