<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
