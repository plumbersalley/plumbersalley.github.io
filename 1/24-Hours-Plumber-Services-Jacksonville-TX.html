<p>As soon as the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be removed from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company offers consist of double check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel models), and reduced pressure zone assemblies.
