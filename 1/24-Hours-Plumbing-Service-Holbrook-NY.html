<p>Numerous toilet problems, including leaking toilets, don't necessitate fixing the entire toilet. Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes lots of small moving parts that may need replaced with usage with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and cause toilet leaks that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
