Appropriate drainage needs to likewise be supplied.</p>

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
