It depends on perspective, and what you as an individual feel are the conveniences you and your household need many.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other types of backflow preventers offered that you may run into. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a dual check".

Double Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>
