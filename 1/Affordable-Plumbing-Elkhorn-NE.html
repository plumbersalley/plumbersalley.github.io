The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main turned off is attached to completion of the water pipe. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
