Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
