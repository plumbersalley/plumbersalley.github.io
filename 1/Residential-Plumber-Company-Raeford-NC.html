Water pressure might stop working or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
