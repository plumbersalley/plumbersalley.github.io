<p>Rusting and deterioration on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can show a prospective problem with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also mean the water heater is near the end of its life.

<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair technician knows the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
