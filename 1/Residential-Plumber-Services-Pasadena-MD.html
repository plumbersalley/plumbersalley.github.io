All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct kind of assembly based upon the conditions on your residential or commercial property (see section listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly should satisfy the lead free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be ceased till the assembly remains in compliance.</p>

When it comes to pipe repair, the most pricey aspects aren't the machinery or materials used, however the uprooting, yard and landscaping damage that occurs.</p>
