<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples found in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 utilised to remove wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the oldest recognized examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had quickly detachable and changeable segments, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>However, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a house owner.
