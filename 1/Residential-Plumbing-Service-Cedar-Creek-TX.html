Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a durable and exceptional option for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining procedure involves our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. When the felt liner is completely saturated, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and cracks. The liner is left to harden in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. Once the process is complete, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be checked one more time to ensure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
