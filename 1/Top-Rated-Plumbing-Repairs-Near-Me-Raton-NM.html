<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Raton NM</h3>

Exemptions, which are approved in extremely uncommon cases where the building is considered to not present a threat to the water system, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
