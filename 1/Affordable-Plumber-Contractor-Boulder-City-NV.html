<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
