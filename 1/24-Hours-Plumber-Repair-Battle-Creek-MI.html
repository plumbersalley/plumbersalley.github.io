<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or steady) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
