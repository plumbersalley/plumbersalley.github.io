<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
