<p>A common whole-house repipe can take anywhere from 3 to five days, depending on the size of the house, how many levels it has actually and the selected pipe material. During a repipe, plumbers will make tactical cuts in the drywall, completely replace the pipes, reinstall the eliminated drywall and spot it to remove any signs of damage or change to your home.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
