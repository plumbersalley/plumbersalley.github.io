<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed properly (Image 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water system line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the main supply of water system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
