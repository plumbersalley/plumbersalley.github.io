<p>Leak detection belongs of water preservation that relies on extremely technical knowledge and customized equipment to identify the place of leaks throughout the city's water circulation system and determine the place of those leakages at which visible water might or may not have actually surfaced.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
