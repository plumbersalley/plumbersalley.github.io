<p>You probably understand one thing about your drains: they take water from your sinks, showers, and tubs to a local water treatment facility. When drains are working correctly that's actually all you need to know about them, but when something goes wrong, you need to have a deeper understanding of what sort of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber comes in-- they have the knowledge to diagnose an issue and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>If you have actually ever been annoyed by cloudy white spots on your meals that will not disappear, white shirts that turn gray and dull after a few washes, or a persistent layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll more than happy to know that water softening can eliminate these problems and more.
