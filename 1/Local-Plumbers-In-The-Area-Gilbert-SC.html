<p>You live in an older house. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>If you've ever been frustrated by cloudy white spots on your meals that will not disappear, white shirts that turn dull and gray after a couple of washes, or a stubborn layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll be happy to know that water softening can remove these problems and more. Hard water triggers these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to fret about any concerns with mineral deposits staying.
