<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most obvious indications of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your house.

That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other devices. Even your water lines should be covered.

After all, excessive pressure can harm your plumbing, and too little can leave your house with dysfunctional water devices.</p>
