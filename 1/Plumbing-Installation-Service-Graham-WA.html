Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
