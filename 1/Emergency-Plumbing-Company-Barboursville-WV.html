<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
