<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the level of the rot.

Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.

The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
