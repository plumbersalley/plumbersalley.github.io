High energy expenses? It might be time for a new warm water heater. But in order to profit of a brand-new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it set up effectively. A hot water heater that is not installed correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, and even a fire.

<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this accreditation.
