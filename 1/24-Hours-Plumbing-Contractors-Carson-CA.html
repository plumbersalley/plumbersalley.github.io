<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>
