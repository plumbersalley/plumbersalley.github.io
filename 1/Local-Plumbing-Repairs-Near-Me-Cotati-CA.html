<p>Referrals: An experienced plumbing company ought to be able to provide you the names of current customers in your part of town. It can take a DIYer a lot of time to locate and total simple repairs, so think about that with the cost when attempting to deal with the problem on your own. The reason a toilet won't flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain underneath the toilet can also be the cause. Employing a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your primary step; a plumber can identify the issue and repair it.</p>
