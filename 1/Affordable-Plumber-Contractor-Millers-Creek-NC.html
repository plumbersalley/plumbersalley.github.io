And these distinctions determine the prospective need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
