<p>Fire department connections can be a concern when used in battling a fire. Firefighters by and large are not worried about backflow prevention concerns. They are interesting in protecting people's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will utilize water from any source offered to achieve that goal.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no modification screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed properly (Photo 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
