<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Lenexa KS</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them functioning effectively. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.
