It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
