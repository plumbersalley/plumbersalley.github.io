Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>
