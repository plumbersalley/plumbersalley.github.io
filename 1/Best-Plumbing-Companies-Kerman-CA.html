<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and consist of the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you must first get the required license( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our License page for additional information on acquiring a permit. As soon as you get an authorization you can commence with the work. Nevertheless, you need to call for inspection before you cover or conceal any work.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Bureau's main focus is on safety within a building. Plumbing inspections make sure that water systems in buildings are connected correctly, without any cross-connection to pollute safe and clean water supply.

Warm water heaters are also examined to make certain that they have been set up appropriately, to avoid a surge.</p>
