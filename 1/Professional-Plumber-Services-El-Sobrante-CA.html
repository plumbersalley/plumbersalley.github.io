<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers El Sobrante CA</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
