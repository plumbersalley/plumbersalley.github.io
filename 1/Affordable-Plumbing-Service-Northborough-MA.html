<p>Plumbing contractors who want to run their own plumbing service may think about finishing a postsecondary business degree program.

<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you do not get that chance.

With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roofing vents or take out a toilet. This is generally more labor-intensive and might need extra costs.
