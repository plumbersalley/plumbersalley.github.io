<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Brownsville TX</h3>

Some homeowners will attempt to remove the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural home remedies, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These remedies do work, especially if you are handling a little drain clog. Nevertheless, they are generally short-term fixes that do not offer long-term resolutions.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a home is due to the fact that there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are quite low-cost and easy to install, so there's no factor not to. When grease solidifies it sticks to the pipe and avoids water flow, ultimately triggering a backup.
