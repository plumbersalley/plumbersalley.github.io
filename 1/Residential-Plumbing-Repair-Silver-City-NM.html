<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.

When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
