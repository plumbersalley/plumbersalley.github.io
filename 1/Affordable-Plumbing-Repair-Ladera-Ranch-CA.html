<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really critical part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
