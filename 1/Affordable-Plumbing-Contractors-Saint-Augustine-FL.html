<p>The best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities website is by installing a pressure decreasing valve (PRV). A PRV will manage water pressure as it enters into the home. According to San Diego utilities, a PRV can also help to conserve water as components in the house will use less water when the pressure is at a lower and more manageable PSI.</p>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
