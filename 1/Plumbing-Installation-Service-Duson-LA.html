<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Duson LA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
