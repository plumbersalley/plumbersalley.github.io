<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Bulverde TX</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to address difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is incredibly important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system.

We provide two types of water treatment systems for difficult water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
