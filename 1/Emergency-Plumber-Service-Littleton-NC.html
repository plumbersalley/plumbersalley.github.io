<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Plumbers install and repair water, gas, and other piping systems in houses, factories, and companies. They install plumbing components, such as toilets and tubs, and appliances, such as dishwashing machines and hot water heater.
