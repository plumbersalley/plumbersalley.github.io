<p>Once the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
