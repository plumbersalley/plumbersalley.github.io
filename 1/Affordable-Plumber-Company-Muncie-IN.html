Then, a new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is linked to its mount.

<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide.

If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of direct or consistent) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
