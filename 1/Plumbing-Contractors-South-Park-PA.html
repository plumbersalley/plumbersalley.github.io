<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber South Park PA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
