<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter season freezing. The brand-new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall material are gotten rid of to connect the pipes to the water components, Wood says. Depending upon the scope of work being performed and the kind of structure, you may have one or more inspections.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
