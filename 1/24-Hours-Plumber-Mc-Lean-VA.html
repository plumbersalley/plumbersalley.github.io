<h3>How To Save Water In An Emergency Plumbing Flood Mc Lean VA</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is incredibly crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Current regulations restrict the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines. We offer 2 types of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
