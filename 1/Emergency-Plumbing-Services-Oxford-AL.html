Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company offers consist of double check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel models), and minimized pressure zone assemblies.

<p>All faucets and valves in your home should be frequently exercised to keep them from freezing in location. For example, a single handle shower valve might become mineralized and calcified triggering it to not operate properly when hired. Much like you and me, routine workout keeps our bodies functioning at a greater level than if we sat not doing anything every day. Anderson Plumbing, Heating and Air can visit your house, inspect the valves throughout your home, and advise you of any options or possible repairs that need to be thought about now or in the near future. An ounce of prevention can suggest the difference between having a working shower valve in the spare bathroom when guests arrive or needing to call a plumber.</p>
