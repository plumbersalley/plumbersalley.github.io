<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you may face. The very first is a check valve. The second is a dual check".

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
