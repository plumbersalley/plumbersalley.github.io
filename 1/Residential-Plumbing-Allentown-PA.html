<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each part. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
