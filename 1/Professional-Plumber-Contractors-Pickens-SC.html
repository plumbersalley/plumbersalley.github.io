<p>Very seldom does any structural damage happen as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is usually found before it causes any significant damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This small hole allows water to continually leak out really gradually. Gradually it can result in a substantial develop of water. Leaked water normally stays under the house and saturates into the ground soil. If the home's foundation was not appropriately compressed, this can potentially cause a cavity. This is an uncommon event and in basic, there is little concern over structural damage as the result of a slab leak.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
