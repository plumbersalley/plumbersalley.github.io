<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of maintaining the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace solidity ions, also has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. Nevertheless, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't drawn in to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is one other important component needed to make the process work: a resin bed consisting of lots of tiny, negatively-charged beads.</p>

The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated directly whenever it's needed. Tankless systems specifically make use of a component that heats up water when the tap is turned on.
