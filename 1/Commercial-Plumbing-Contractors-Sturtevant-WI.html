<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
