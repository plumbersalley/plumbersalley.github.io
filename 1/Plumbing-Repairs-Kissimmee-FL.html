<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
