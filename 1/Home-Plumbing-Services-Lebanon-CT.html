<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Lebanon CT</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI.
