<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable amount, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
