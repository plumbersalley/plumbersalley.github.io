<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in floorings, joists, and studs.

A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and lawsuits.

<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending upon if you use PEX, copper, or another material. Changing galvanized pipes in older homes is important because of the method galvanized pipes tend to degrade over the years. Galvanized pipe is made by finish steel pipe with zinc. As time moves on, the zinc wears down, exposing the steel.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>

<p>If you notice low water pressure or discolored water, it generally symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up in time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may see lower water pressure. The staining occurs when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your water supply, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health threat in your water.</p>
