<p>Utilize the convenient self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several houses in my community being repiped and have spoken to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Obviously it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage if the leak isn't found soon.</p>
