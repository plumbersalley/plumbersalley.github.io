Difficult water disrupts the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>
