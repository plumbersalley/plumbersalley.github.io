<p>You most likely know something about your drains: they take water from your sinks, showers, and tubs to a local water treatment center. When drains are working correctly that's really all you need to learn about them, however when something goes wrong, you need to have a much deeper understanding of what sort of problems can occur in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber is available in-- they have the competence to diagnose a problem and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
