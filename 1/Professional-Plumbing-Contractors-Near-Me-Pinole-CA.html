<p>Loose flanges are typically the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the extent of the rot.

Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
