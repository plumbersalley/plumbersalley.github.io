<p>When a gas line is burst, it instantly becomes a serious security hazard.

<p>If you notice low water pressure or discolored water, it normally signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop with time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you might discover lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
