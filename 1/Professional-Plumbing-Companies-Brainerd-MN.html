<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
