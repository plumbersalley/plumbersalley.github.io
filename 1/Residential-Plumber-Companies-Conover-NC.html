<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
