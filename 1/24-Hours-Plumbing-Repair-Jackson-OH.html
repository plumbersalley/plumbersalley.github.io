<p>These guys were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
