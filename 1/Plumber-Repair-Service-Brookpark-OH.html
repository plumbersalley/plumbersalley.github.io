<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
