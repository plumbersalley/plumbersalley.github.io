<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>

With over 45 years of experience to our name, Expense Frusco Plumbing and Heating is your primary option for plumbing and A/C services. Tru-Soft ® Solar Salt water Blocks are produced for the requirements of many water softener systems. The solar crystals are collected, kiln dried and compressed into 50 Lb. blocks.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then return to service. Because they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally regenerate after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
