<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both places. The backflow preventer you select should be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed must have been listed at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company supplies include check valve assemblies, check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel designs), and minimized pressure zone assemblies. Pointer: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, get rid of the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet prior to mounting the disposal. Also connect the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet when you attach the P-trap.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, UPC design code requires stand-alone residential systems utilizing non-potable piping materials to attain the same level of defense as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire protection system provided by a potable water supply, increased security is likewise needed.

Hanging on a pipeline might trigger it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the home.
