<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
