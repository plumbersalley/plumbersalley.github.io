<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
