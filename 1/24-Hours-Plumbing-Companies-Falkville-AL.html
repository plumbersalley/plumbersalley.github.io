<p>If your assembly fails the annual test, you are accountable for fixing or replacing the assembly within one month. All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper type of assembly based on the conditions on your property (see area listed below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Moreover, the assembly needs to meet the lead complimentary requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be discontinued up until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>

Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
