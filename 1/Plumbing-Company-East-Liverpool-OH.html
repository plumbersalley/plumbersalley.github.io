<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently get rid of solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid normally will help remove them if you have rust spots. If you want to try the gentlest method maybe attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke.
