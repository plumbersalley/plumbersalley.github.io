<p>3. Solar Salt comes from vaporized seawater and might often leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in tubs and sinks. The pink movie is really a safe bacteria that comes from the sea salt. If this stain is an annoyance in your house, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends switching to among the other two kinds of salts. As soon as the brand-new salt has had an opportunity to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as instructed in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
