<p>The cost to replace galvanized pipes is from $2,000 to $15,000 depending on if you use PEX, copper, or another material.

<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might take place. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not correctly safeguarded, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>While fighting a fire, firefighters are naturally more worried about drawing adequate water to splash the blaze than backflow prevention. Not just will they utilize water from any offered source to achieve their objective, however fire department cars often bring non-potable water treated with antifreeze, corrosion inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
