The majority of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for security and comfort.

It actually isn't an excellent idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been specifically designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight equally and might ultimately trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
