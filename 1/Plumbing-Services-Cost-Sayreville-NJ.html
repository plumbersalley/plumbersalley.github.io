<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>

When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
