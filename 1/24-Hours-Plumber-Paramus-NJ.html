<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Paramus NJ</h3>
<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has frequently been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely removes hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>The most common technique for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another aspect, usually sodium. Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes just a really percentage of sodium to your water. According to the Mayo Center, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of salt, which is thought about very low sodium" by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
