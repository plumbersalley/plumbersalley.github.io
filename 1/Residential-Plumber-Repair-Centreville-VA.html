<p>Your waste disposal unit guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
