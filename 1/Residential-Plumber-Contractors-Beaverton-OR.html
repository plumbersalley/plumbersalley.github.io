Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Each part of the assembly need to be tested to identify what needs repair. The field test may not constantly show you the seriousness of the failure or whether repair parts beyond the fundamental rubber repair set are needed. There might be additional test procedures, beyond those developed in the tester accreditation program, that can provide data revealing the seriousness of the failure that might help in the diagnostic analysis of the backflow prevention assembly.</p>
