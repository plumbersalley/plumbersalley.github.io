<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
