<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>When pipes are set up into a vertical form it is referred to as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop need to be greater than 33 feet to function properly. When designed in this manner it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water supply. Plumb Crazy Plumbing uses a standard 1 month warranty on repairs, drain cleaning and 1 year service warranty on replacement plumbing tasks.</p>
