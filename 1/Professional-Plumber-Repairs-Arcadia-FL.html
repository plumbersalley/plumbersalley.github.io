<p>Any location water runs through home. This includes sinks, toilets, lines, tubs, and pipes. At this time, the pro will try to find leakages and broken pipes or fittings. With toilets, the pro will inspect water levels, flappers, and filler systems. He or she will eyeball visible pipes, and may run a camera inspection to inspect the pipes' condition from the inside.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new smooth pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for as much as 100 years.</p>
