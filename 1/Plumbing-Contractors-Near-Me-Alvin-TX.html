<p>With PVC you have a couple of choices if your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering a blockage. The other is to go on and replace the entire line. Certainly replace if the line is about 40 years old and is showing signs of age throughout. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it might be an acceptable option to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be a choice.</p>
