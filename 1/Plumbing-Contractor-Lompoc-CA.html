<p>There are numerous causes for blockages depending on where they occur in your plumbing Toilets clog from too much toilet tissue for the a lot of part. When the toilet tissue gathers in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet instead of streaming through it, the toilet will not flush. The water only back up in the bowl.
