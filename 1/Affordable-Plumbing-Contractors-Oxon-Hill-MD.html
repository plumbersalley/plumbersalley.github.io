<h3>Some Effective Unclogging Strategies You Can Try at Oxon Hill MD 20745</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
