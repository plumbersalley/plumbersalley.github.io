<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
