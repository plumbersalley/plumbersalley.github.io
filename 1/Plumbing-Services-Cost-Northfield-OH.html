<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indicators of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in studs, floors, and joists. Finally, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with an inferior plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the task with insurance claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
