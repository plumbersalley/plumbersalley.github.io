<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
