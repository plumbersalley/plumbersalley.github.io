<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the option with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without solidity ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>The most common method for producing soft water is through ion exchange, a procedure in which the calcium and magnesium in the water are exchanged for another aspect, generally sodium. Salt will not cause lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening adds just a very percentage of salt to your water. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce glass of soft water would have less than 12.5 milligrams of sodium, which is considered very low sodium" by the Fda.</p>
