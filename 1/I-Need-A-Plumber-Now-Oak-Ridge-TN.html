The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the kind of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>

<p>Prior to the repair technician starts the repair process, he must be sure he has actually examined the workspace around the backflow prevention assembly in order to recognize any restrictive conditions. If the area is considered a confined space, appropriate security preventative measures need to be followed for appropriate entry. A safe and appropriate workplace might involve the placement of safety barriers or entry restrictions around the work area so the repair technician or the general public around your workspace are not hurt.
