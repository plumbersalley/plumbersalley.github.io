We can finish any required water softener repairs. If a full water softener replacement must be required, we can do that too. Your water quality really is too important to take any chances with.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the perpetrator. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
