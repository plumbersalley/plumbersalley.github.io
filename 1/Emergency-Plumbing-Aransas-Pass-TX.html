You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you observe your water has an uncommon circulation, smell, color or taste. A plumbing professional can determine whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature or pressure may require replacing the water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
<p>The usual service is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, however steel ultimately suffers from deterioration and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

In safe and clean water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a life span of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water contaminants.</p>
