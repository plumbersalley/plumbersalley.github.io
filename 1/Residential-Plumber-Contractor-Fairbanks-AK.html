<p>A general rule is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself.

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.
