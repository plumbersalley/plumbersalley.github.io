<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of preserving the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace solidity ions, likewise has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. Nevertheless, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't drawn in to each other, how can an exchange happen?

Typically, a whole-house repipe is worth the investment in the long run due to the fact that it may resolve the root reason for the persistent plumbing problems in your home.</p>
