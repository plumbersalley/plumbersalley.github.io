<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
