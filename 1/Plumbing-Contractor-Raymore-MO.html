<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running devices such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially called marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the decaying of raw materials like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to prevent off that threat, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Make certain to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
