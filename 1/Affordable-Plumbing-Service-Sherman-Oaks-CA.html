<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Sherman Oaks CA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Strainers are advised prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire fighting water lines. No strainer is to be used in a fire line without the approval of the Insurance Underwriters or the authority having jurisdiction.
