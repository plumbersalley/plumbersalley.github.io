Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
