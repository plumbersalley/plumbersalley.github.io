<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, generally regrow after many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
