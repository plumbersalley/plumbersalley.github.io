<p>Every affordable buyer checks at least several things before making a deposit on a home. Thinking about going tankless? We repair and install tankless hot water heater Offer us a call to see if one of these units is right for your house. Good short article on the Backflow Prevention Devices. There is another device Hose Vacuum Breaker (HVB) which need to be set up on all garden hose bibs to avoid infected yard water being sucked in to the drinking supply of water network.

<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you select need to be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted should have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
