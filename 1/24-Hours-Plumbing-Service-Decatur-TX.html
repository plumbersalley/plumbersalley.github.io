If your home was constructed prior to the 1970s, we highly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was constructed decades before that, possibilities are that your house may need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimum rates.</p>

The correction should be made prior to water service is allowed if the existing backflow is not up to District code. Cost for the device is covered by either the renter or the residential or commercial property owner.</p>
