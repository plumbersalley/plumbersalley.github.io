<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people expect to see but hardly ever stop to think about. Energy Performance. Choosing a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is recommended. The energy performance of a storage hot water heater is indicated by its Energy Factor (EF). The more effective the water heater the greater the EF rating. However, just because a water heater has a greater EF value, it doesn't always imply it will have lower operating expense.
