<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the solution is to repair the broken section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to fix the concern. Other times a more comprehensive service is required: repiping.</p>

<p>One common way for a house's water system to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue might spread out exponentially if that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply. A backflow preventer not just safeguards drinking water in specific houses, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and polluting the public water system.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic ways of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
