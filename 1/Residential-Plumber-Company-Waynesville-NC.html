<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning fraud.</p>
