Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace solidity ions, likewise has a positive charge, so none of these ions are drawn in to each other.

Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
