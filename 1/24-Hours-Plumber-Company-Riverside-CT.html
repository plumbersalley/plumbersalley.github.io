<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>In some situations, the needed toilet repair outweighs the investment of a brand-new toilet.
