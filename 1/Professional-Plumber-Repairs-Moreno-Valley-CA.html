<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of preserving the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you observe unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this could be an indication that sediment has developed in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating aspect. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
