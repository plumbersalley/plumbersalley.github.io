<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs.
