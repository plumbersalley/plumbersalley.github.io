<p>The U-shaped pipe below kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but hardly ever stop to think about. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom manage (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Dual Checks. There are 2 other kinds of backflow preventers offered that you might run into. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Check although it might be marketed as one! Do not get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses comparable to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>
