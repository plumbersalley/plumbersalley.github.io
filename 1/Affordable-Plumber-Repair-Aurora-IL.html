Blanc also built a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
