Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
