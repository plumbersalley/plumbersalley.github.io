<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
