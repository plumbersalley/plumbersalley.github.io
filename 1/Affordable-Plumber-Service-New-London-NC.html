<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and minimizes the standard structural integrity of the system.

Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to identify.</p>

<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
