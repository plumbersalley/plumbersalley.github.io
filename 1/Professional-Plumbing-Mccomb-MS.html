<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
