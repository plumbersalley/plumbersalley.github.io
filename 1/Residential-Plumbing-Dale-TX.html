Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
