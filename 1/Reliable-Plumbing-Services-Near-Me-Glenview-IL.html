Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. It is essential that you contact a certified plumber if there is a persistent sewage smell in your home. Raw sewage is extremely dangerous and can pose severe health threats.</p>
<p>When a natural gas line is ruptured, it immediately becomes a severe security danger.

But their added up-front expenses mean it pays to look before you jump.</p>
