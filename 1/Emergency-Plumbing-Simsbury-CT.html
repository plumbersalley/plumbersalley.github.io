<p>I can't state enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had a really short amount of time due to closing on a house sale. Every single individual I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew. Friendly, interacted well, absolutely responsive and really cared to help me through this extremely difficult job. All of the people I experienced were good example for what a well run service business need to be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're great.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
