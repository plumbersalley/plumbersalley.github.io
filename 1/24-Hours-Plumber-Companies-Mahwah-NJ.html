<p>The purpose of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing installed throughout building and construction of a new or renovated building is set up by experienced artisans in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you usually know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

Obstructions in a fixture can cause destructive damage to your draining pipes system the longer they persist.</p>
