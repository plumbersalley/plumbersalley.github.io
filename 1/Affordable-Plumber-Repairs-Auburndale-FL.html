<p>A plumbing floor plan (plan view) or partial floor plan indicating water services, name and address of facility, water meter layout, proposed backflow preventer( s), booster pump system, floor drain( s) and all close-by objects (examples: electrical panels, boilers, chillers, storage tanks, fire pumps, fire sprinkler risers, and so on). The plan should be drawn to scale or with dimensions suggested from walls and all neighboring objects.</p>
<p>While fighting a fire, firefighters are understandably more concerned about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention.
