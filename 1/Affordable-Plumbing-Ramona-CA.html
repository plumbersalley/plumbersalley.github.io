<h3>Frozen Pips in Ramona California</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
