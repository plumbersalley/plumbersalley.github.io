The exposure to carbon monoxide is so fatal that anyone who inhales it requires instant medical attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that 5149 people died from carbon monoxide poisoning between 1999 and 2010. To avoid this catastrophe, make sure to use your gas stoves precisely as instructed and never to use them to heat your home. The same goes for portable gas stoves, which are to be used outdoors only and not inside. When running the space-heaters, ensure someone is awake to monitor them. Numerous families die in their sleep due to carbon monoxide poisoning over night. Another safety measure to take is to never ever run your generators in enclosed areas.
