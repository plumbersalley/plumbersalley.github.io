<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of preserving the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you observe strange popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this could be an indication that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component.

To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
