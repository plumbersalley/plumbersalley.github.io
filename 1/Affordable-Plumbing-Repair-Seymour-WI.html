<p>A. If you have rust spots, utilizing phosphoric acid typically will help remove them. If you would like to try the gentlest method perhaps attempt utilizing some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola consists of a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't suffice then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (make certain to check out the directions and safety cautions initially!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust discolorations and it's easily available at most hardware stores.</p>
