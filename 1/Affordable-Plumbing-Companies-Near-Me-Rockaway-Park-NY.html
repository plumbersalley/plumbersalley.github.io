<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

While galvanized steel is strong, it generally catches rust after about 50 years and requires replacement.
