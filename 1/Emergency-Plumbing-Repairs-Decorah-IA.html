<p>Often, problems with plumbing will be misdiagnosed by untrained or less thorough plumbers. So, you'll discover the very same problems cropping up again and once again, despite the fact that you've had them fixed.

The specialist plumbers at Royal Class Service are here to clean your drains and look after your house.</p>
<p>Frequently triggered by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then check and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a faulty fill valve might actuate periodically, as well. Water won't drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
