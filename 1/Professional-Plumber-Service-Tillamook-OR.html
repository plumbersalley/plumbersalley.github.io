When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task.
