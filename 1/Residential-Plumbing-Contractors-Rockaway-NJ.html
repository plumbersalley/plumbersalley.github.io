<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>
