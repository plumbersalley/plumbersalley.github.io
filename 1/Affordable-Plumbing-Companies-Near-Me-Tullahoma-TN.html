<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
