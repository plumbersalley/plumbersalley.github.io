<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Newtown CT</h3>
<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that particular magnetic and electro-magnetic devices can be effective in preventing scale formation in tough water supply. It is really hard to judge such claims, which are practically never ever based on tests that are well adequate explained to enable others to assess them and to confirm the results. While the lack of "scientific" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it needs to make one be reluctant to accept it without some assurance of performance.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
