<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will advise a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
