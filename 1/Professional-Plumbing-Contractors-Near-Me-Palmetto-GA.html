<p>The normal solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually suffers from corrosion and lacks the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
