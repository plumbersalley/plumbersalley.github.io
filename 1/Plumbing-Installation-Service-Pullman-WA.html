<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
