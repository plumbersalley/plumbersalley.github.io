When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
