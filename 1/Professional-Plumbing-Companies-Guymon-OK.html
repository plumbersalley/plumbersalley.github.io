It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in locations subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage should likewise be offered.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
