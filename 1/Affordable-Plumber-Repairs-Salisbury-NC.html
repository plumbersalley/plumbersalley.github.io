<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is devoid of firmness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
