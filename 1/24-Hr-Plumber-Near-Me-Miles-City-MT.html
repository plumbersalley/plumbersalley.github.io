Idea: If the disposal has a line to the dishwasher, eliminate the plastic drain plug (or "knockout") from the disposal inlet before installing the disposal. When you attach the P-trap, also attach the dishwasher discharge tube to the inlet.</p>
<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer requires numerous items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be examined. The installation should be assessed to guarantee it does not circumvent the workings of the assembly. Test information must be built up to identify the functions of each part.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
