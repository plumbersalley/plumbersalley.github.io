<p>3. Solar Salt comes from evaporated seawater and may sometimes leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink movie is in fact a safe bacteria that comes from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends changing to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your home. Once the brand-new salt has had a possibility to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then purchase some water softener filter cleaner to clean out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are certain pollutants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help relieve those issues. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils which too can be treated with the right RO system.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and scenarios that need backflow prevention gadgets. For home, it is important for owners to notify the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial home, the District evaluates the use of each brand-new occupant. If the current backflow is not up to District code, the correction should be made prior to water service is allowed. Cost for the device is covered by either the property or the tenant owner.</p>
<p>A variety of organizations, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer certification courses designed to train professionals to test backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to become certified.</p>
