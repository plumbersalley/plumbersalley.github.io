The secret to the innovation is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, therefore getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Traditional tank water heaters: These heaters use electricity and gas for fuel. They can warm anywhere from 20 to 100 gallons of water at a time.
