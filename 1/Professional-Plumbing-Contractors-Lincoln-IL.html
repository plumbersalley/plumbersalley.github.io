<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. If it has, you probably have a leak.</p>
<p>Toilet flush handles are another part of a toilet that can cause toilets to keep running. Often handles are toilet parts that get loose or rusty and no longer pull the flap up or drop it pull back properly. It's an easy repair, but there's a technique to getting the flush deal with out. The retaining nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you remain in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the delegated loosen (Image 1).

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
