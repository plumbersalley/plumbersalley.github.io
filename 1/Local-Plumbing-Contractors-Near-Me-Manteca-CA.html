<p>Rusting and rust on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can suggest a possible issue with the hot water heater.

With heavy rust accumulation on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could suggest that there have actually been changes in pressure triggering little leakages.</p>
