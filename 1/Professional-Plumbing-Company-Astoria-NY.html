<p>A cross-connection is any momentary or irreversible connection between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>A leak in a single pipe can easily be fixed by replacing that section of harmed piping. However, when the issue is found in pipes throughout your home, it might be time to think about whole-house repiping. Few homeowners are thrilled with the concept of replacing all their pipes, however handling the job before the plumbing system fails enables you to prevent significant property damage.</p>
