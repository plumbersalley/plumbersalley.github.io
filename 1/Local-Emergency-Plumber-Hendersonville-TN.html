You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
