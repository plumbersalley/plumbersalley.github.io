Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to guarantee there is an air gap, if there is no way to supply one, then we inspect to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to carry out website inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is needed as an outcome of a prospective or actual cross-connection threat on a consumer's plumbing system.
