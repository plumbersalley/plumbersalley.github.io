<p>Remember that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you must only employ a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Leak legs record wetness so that it doesn't go into the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment might make it through a drip leg.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
