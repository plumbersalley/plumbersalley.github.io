<p>Sewer lines have one vital function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. The majority of folks replace their water heaters due to poor performance, complete failure or as a preventive step. If your hot water heater is more than 10 years old, it's time to think about changing it with a more effective design. Water on the floor can mean worn parts. Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the everyday costs and aggravations incurred by difficult water, a water softener is ultimately an investment that will save you a considerable amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is considerably surpassed by the cash and energy saved.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
