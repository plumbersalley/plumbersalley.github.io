Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the everyday costs and aggravations incurred by difficult water, a water softener is ultimately an investment that will save you a considerable amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is considerably surpassed by the cash and energy saved.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position.
