The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it goes into the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water main. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

You can install brand-new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per direct foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per direct foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under homes, sometimes in concrete.
