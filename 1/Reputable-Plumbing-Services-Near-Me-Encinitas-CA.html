<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>We recommend that property owners buy cleaning from a drain cleaning plumber at least once each year to clean out the drains and keep whatever running efficiently. It's also useful due to the fact that, at the same time, the plumber can anticipate the drains and recommend any drain repair, or drain cleaning service. In some cases whatever is obstructing the drain won't budge. It might be time to call a professional plumber if you have actually tried to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink with no luck. They can determine the area of the obstruction and the very best methods to unclog the bottleneck without harming your plumbing.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and lift the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no change screw. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
