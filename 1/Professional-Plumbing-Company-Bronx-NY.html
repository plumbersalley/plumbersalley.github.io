<p>The Plumbing Inspections group is comprised of 6 State of Ohio-certified plumbing inspectors, among which is also functions as the Supervising Inspector and the Plumbing Plan Inspector for the group. Toilets save lives. It may sound crazy, however it holds true. Correct sanitation in the type of working toilets and properly maintained sewage systems helps prevent possibly deadly diseases from assaulting you and your family. In the United States we are incredibly lucky that most of us never ever need to stress over catching such health problems, however it is still essential to keep our toilets clean and in excellent operating condition to avoid the potential for disease to our families - in addition to conserving ourselves the basic hassle and high cost of toilet problems left ignored for too long.

The threat of an imperfect installation is that concerns, like leaks or wiring, may not be apparent to an untrained eye during the checks. These are not just going to cause the disposal not to work properly but are dangerous.</p>
