<p>Nevertheless, most of the time, it's safe to say that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the pocketbook of a homeowner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department should satisfy or exceed the state requirements and bring the obligation for imposing them.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
