<p>Natural gas is difficult to spot, as it's a colorless, odor-free compound. We use natural gas in our houses with gas ranges, heaters, and ovens. American homes access natural gas through miles and miles of underground pipelines. Having a natural gas leak from an outdoor pipeline and indoor appliances can occur rapidly and all of a sudden.
