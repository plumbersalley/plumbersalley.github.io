<p>Keep in mind that repiping a home is a major plumbing repair, and you should only work with a relied on and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg.
