<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) provide accreditation courses developed to train experts to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>
