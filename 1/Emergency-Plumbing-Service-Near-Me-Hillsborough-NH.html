<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Hillsborough NH</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a fair cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it also.</p>
