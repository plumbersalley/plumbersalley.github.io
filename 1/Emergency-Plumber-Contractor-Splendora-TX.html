<p>If it becomes difficult to turn; it's most likely you've encountered a clog, turn the handle counterclockwise. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of particles.

<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
