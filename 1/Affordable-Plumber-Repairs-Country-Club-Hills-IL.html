<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively because difficult water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use more and more cleaning agent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Hard minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected during regrowth. Lastly, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
