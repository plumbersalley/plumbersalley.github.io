Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
