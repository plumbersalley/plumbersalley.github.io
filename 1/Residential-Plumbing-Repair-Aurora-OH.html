<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Aurora OH</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
