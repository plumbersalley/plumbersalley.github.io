<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Blairstown NJ</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>Toilets are hard things to know. They have actually been constructed pretty much the exact same method for hundreds of years, so you can't actually tell how old they are. It may not work very well all the time, however you can't tell if that's normal or not. Plus, there's that never unacknowledged however universal sensation that it's you-you're somehow doing something incorrect therein.</p>
