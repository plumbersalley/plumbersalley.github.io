<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Calimesa CA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
