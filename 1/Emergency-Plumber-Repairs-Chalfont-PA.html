<p>If a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-effective, house owners frequently ask. The answer depends on your home.

Toilet leakages around the base can likewise take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
