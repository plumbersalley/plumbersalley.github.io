Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older areas where clay pipe may have been utilized. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as intensified if pipes have actually been permitted to freeze.</p>
<p>In many cases, a gas line may be covered if it is ruptured. This type of situation may happen if a contractor is working on an individual's landscaping and inadvertently burst a line. A property owner's policy may cover this type of repair. In addition, if a rupture is developed by an utility company, it might be covered. The sediment trap parts cost $10 to $14 each and plumbers will have the ability to install it within an hour.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
