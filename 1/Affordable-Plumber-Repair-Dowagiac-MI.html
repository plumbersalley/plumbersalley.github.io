<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
