<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each part. If the component is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
