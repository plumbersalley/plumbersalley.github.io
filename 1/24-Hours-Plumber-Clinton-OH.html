<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller sized model that operated on the same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable.
