At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and after that return to service.

Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally restore after many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
