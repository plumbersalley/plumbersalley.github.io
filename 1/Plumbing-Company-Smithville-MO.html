Backflow Preventer definition: A device that permits water to go through it in one instructions, however avoids it from reversing in the opposite instructions.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, however steel eventually struggles with corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
