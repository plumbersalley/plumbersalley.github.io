<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth instantly starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
