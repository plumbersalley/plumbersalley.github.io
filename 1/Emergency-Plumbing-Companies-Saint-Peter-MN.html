<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to determine on each element is the guide.

If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities.

In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
