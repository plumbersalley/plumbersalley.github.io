It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
