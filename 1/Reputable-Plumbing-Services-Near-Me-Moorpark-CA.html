<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to examine. If your toilet is reasonably brand-new, you may need to switch bathroom tissue or employ a plumber to clear a clog from the drain.

Place a container underneath the area to catch water then loosen the two threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in place. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
