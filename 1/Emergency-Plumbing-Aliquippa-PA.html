<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Everybody who's set up a couple of disposals knows this mistake: Forgetting to get rid of the dishwasher knockout prior to hanging the system. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently used and you have actually replaced the flapper, the problem might be larger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its ability to seal correctly, producing waste and a higher water expense.</p>
