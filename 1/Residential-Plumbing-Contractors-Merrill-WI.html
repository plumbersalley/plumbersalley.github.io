The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; extra, more considerable expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for citizens. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist figure out.</p>
