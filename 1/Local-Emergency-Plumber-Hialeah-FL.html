<p>To figure out if your home is a poly home," begin with the outside. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main turned off is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Gas companies typically do not charge for the initial visit as their concern is to stop any gas leakages or problems. If you have a small leak, your gas bills may be greater than typical. Water conditioners utilize an electronic filter to get rid of minerals and smells discovered in tough water. It can help make devices last longer, washing and washing easier, and prevent discolorations. Water conditioners are low maintenance, you do not need to include chemicals or salt.</p>
