Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
