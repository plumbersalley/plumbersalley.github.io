<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Ashdown AR</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>You hear water leaking or running in the tank. When water runs backwards through your pipes and into the drinking water system, a backflow takes place.
