<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow.
