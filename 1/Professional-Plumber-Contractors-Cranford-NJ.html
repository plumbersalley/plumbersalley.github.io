<p>You are responsible for changing the assembly or repairing within 30 days if your assembly fails the annual test. All replacements must be installed to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the appropriate type of assembly based on the conditions on your home (see section below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly needs to meet the lead totally free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be terminated up until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
<p>When a gas line is burst, it immediately ends up being a major security hazard. Without being repaired as quickly as possible, it might cause a fair bit of damage if the natural gas inside ends up being fired up. If an individual realizes that they have burst a gas line, the first concern is to shut off the supply of gas and call the utility company.</p>
