The key to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief technology officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
